# Validation Notes:
# 1. 8312-20 343T max head is 7.7m - critical for range validation
# 2. System correctly filters out pumps exceeding physical capabilities
# 3. Axial flow pumps properly classified after corrections
# 4. High head applications correctly routed to VTP/MULTISTAGE pumps

# This reference validates our range validation improvements are working correctly
