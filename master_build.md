  - Engineering view as default for all pump selections
  - Interactive Plotly.js performance curves
  - Professional PDF report generation with WeasyPrint
  - Unified navigation system with dropdown menus
  - Responsive design with Bootstrap/Materialize CSS
  - Advanced filtering with range sliders
  - Expanded shortlist capacity (10 pumps)

#### 6. **Admin & Configuration**
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
- **Features:**
  - Dynamic threshold configuration UI
  - Application profiles for different use cases
  - AI knowledge base management
  - Document library system
  - Performance testing dashboard
  - Database vs UI validation tools

## Recent Critical Fixes (August 7, 2025)

### Data Integrity Overhaul
1. **BEP Field Mapping:** Fixed to use authentic database specifications
2. **Status Case Mismatch:** Corrected return values for accuracy statistics
3. **Default Value Contamination:** Removed hardcoded defaults
4. **Power Validation:** Removed invalid comparisons (no authentic power data)
5. **Operating Envelopes:** Using authentic pump curves instead of fixed percentages

### Navigation Architecture
1. **Blueprint Conflicts:** Resolved duplicate reports_bp registration
2. **Template Consolidation:** Fixed double navigation bar issues
3. **Route Standardization:** All routes use Flask url_for()
4. **Template Block Cleanup:** Removed orphaned Jinja2 blocks

### AI Chat Enhancements
1. **Pump Lookup Fix:** Now searches both pump_code and pump_name fields
2. **BEP Data Display:** Shows complete specifications from database
3. **Unit Recognition:** Accepts multiple flow rate formats
4. **Global Availability:** Chat accessible on all pages
5. **Autocomplete:** Full keyboard navigation support

## Performance Metrics

- **Database Load Time:** ~1.2 seconds for 386 pumps
- **Selection Algorithm:** 50-100ms for 386 pump evaluation
- **Chart Rendering:** <500ms per performance curve
- **PDF Generation:** 2-3 seconds per report
- **Chat Response:** 200-300ms for pump lookups
- **API Response:** <200ms for pump list endpoint

## Testing Coverage

### Automated Tests
- ✅ Database connection and schema validation
- ✅ BEP data field verification
- ✅ Pump selection algorithm accuracy
- ✅ API endpoint response validation
- ✅ Chat query parsing and response

### Manual Testing Completed

## Deployment Information

### Environment Variables Required
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Flask session security key
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Optional for AI features
- `GOOGLE_GEMINI_KEY` - Optional alternative AI

### Server Configuration

4. **Browser Support:** Optimized for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Upcoming Enhancements (Planned)

- [ ] Power consumption curves when data available
- [ ] Multi-language support for global deployment
- [ ] Advanced pump comparison with side-by-side charts
- [ ] Historical selection tracking and analytics
- [ ] Mobile app development
- [ ] API rate limiting and authentication
