**CRITICAL METHODOLOGY:**
1. **SHARED X-AXIS ANALYSIS:**
   - Locate the single X-axis at the bottom spanning all charts
   - Read the LEFTMOST and RIGHTMOST numerical labels EXACTLY
   - Note the unit (typically m³/hr or similar)

2. **INDIVIDUAL Y-AXIS ANALYSIS:**
   - For each chart (Head, Power, NPSH), find its dedicated Y-axis
   - Read the BOTTOM-MOST and TOP-MOST numerical labels EXACTLY
   - Identify the unit for each axis

**COORDINATE READING RULES:**
- Only read numbers that are CLEARLY VISIBLE on the axis tick marks
- If a value is partially obscured, use the nearest clearly visible value
- Ensure min < max for all axes
- Double-check units match the axis labels
