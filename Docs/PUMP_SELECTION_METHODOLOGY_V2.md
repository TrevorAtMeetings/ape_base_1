## Overview

The APE Pumps Selection Application employs a sophisticated, multi-tiered approach to pump selection that balances technical requirements with practical considerations. The system prioritizes reliability, efficiency, and operational cost while ensuring that selected pumps meet the specified duty conditions.

### Core Principles
- **Reliability First**: Prioritize operation near Best Efficiency Point (BEP)
- **Right-Sizing**: Avoid both undersizing and excessive oversizing
- **Total Cost of Ownership**: Consider both initial and operational costs
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Use actual pump performance data from 386 pump models

## Selection Process Flow

### 1. Initial Data Collection
The process begins with gathering essential site requirements:
- **Flow Rate** (m³/hr or GPM with automatic conversion)
- **Total Head** (meters or feet with automatic conversion)
- **Pump Type** (Axial Flow, Mixed Flow, Centrifugal, or General)
- **Application Type** (Water Supply, Wastewater, Industrial, etc.)
- **Optional Parameters**: NPSHa, fluid properties, temperature

### 2. Database Query and Filtering
The system queries the PostgreSQL database containing:
- 386 pump models
- 869 performance curves
- 7,043 performance data points

Filtering criteria:
- Pump type matching (if specified)
- Basic performance envelope check
- Manufacturer availability

### 3. Comprehensive Performance Evaluation

#### 3.1 Multi-Curve Analysis
For each candidate pump, the system evaluates ALL available impeller curves:
1. **Direct Match**: Check if duty point falls within any curve's tested range
2. **Interpolation**: For duty points between available curves
3. **Affinity Law Scaling**: Apply for both:
   - Speed variation (750-3600 RPM limits)
   - Impeller trimming (80-100% diameter limits)
4. **Safe Extrapolation**: Allow up to ±10% beyond tested ranges

#### 3.2 Exclusion Logic
Pumps are only excluded after exhaustive evaluation:
- **All curves checked**: Every impeller configuration tested
- **All scaling methods attempted**: Speed, trim, and combinations
- **Physical limits validated**: Manufacturer constraints respected

#### 3.3 Proper Categorization
Exclusions use accurate, actionable reasons:
- **"No performance data"**: Only when literally no curves exist
- **"Flow outside pump capacity"**: Duty flow exceeds all curves even at max trim
- **"Head outside pump envelope"**: Cannot achieve required head within limits
- **"Excessive trim required"**: Would need <80% or >100% impeller
- **"Speed out of motor range"**: Would exceed 750-3600 RPM limits

### 4. Performance Calculation
For feasible pumps:
1. **Exact Duty Point**: Calculate using interpolation or scaling
2. **Best Operating Point**: Find optimal flow within ±5% for efficiency
3. **Validation**: Ensure solution respects all physical constraints

### 5. Scoring and Ranking
Apply the comprehensive 100-point scoring system (detailed below)

### 6. Engineering Flexibility & Guidance

#### 6.1 Near-Miss Analysis
When no pumps meet exact requirements, the system provides:
- **Small Adjustment Suggestions**: "Increasing head by 1.5m would enable 6 additional pumps"
- **Flow Flexibility**: "Reducing flow by 5% brings 12 pumps into range"
- **Parallel Configuration**: "Two pumps at 50% flow each can meet requirements"

#### 6.2 Right-of-BEP Preference
Industry best practice for longevity:
- **Sweet Spot**: 105-115% of BEP preferred
- **Acceptable Range**: 70-120% of BEP
- **Visual Indicators**: Green highlights for right-of-BEP operation

#### 6.3 Practical Engineering Context
- **10-15% Site Flexibility**: Most applications allow minor adjustments
- **Future Wear Allowance**: Right-of-BEP provides margin for degradation
- **System Curve Reality**: Actual operation often differs from design

### 7. Alternative Generation
Generate up to 10 alternative selections with:
- Clear differentiation (efficiency vs. initial cost vs. reliability)
- Parallel pump options when appropriate
- Custom trim possibilities flagged

### 8. Comparison and Reporting
Enable side-by-side comparison with:
- Lifecycle cost analysis
- Exclusion transparency
- What-if scenarios

## Scoring System Architecture

### Total Score: 100 Points Maximum

#### 1. BEP Proximity Score (40 points max) - THE RELIABILITY FACTOR
**Purpose**: Heavily reward operation near the pump's Best Efficiency Point

**Formula**: 
```
Flow_Ratio = Duty_Flow / BEP_Flow
Score = 40 × max(0, 1 - ((Flow_Ratio - 1) / 0.5)²)
```

**Behavior**:
- At BEP (Flow_Ratio = 1.0): 40 points
- At 70% or 130% of BEP: 3.6 points
- At 50% or 150% of BEP: 0 points
- Outside 50% deviation: 0 points (natural filter)

#### 2. Efficiency Score (30 points max) - THE OPERATING COST FACTOR
**Purpose**: Reward high efficiency at the duty point

**Formula**: 
```
Score = (Efficiency_at_Duty_Point % / 100) × 30
```

**Minimum Threshold**: Pumps with <40% efficiency are disqualified

#### 3. Head Margin Score (15 points max to -∞) - THE RIGHT-SIZING FACTOR
**Purpose**: Reward ideal safety margins and aggressively penalize oversizing

**Piece-wise Function**:
| Margin Range | Score Calculation | Example (15% margin) |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| < -2% | Disqualified | N/A |
| -2% to +5% | 15 points | 15 points |
| +5% to +20% | 15 - 0.5 × (Margin - 5) | 10 points |
| +20% to +50% | 7.5 - 0.25 × (Margin - 20) | 2.5 points |
| > +50% | 0 - 0.1 × (Margin - 50) | Negative score |

#### 4. NPSH Score (15 points max) - THE CAVITATION RISK FACTOR
**Two Modes**:

**Mode A - NPSHa Known**:
```
NPSH_Margin_Ratio = NPSHa / NPSHr
Score = 15 × max(0, min(1, (NPSH_Margin_Ratio - 1.1) / (2.0 - 1.1)))
```

**Mode B - NPSHa Unknown** (Default):
- NPSHr ≤ 2m: 15 points
- NPSHr ≥ 8m: 0 points
- Linear scaling between

#### 5. Speed Variation Penalty (up to -15 points)
**Formula**: 
```
Penalty = min(15, 1.5 × Speed_Change_%)
```

#### 6. Impeller Trimming Penalty
**Formula**: 
```
Penalty = 0.5 × Trim_%
```

### Final Score Calculation
```
Total_Score = BEP_Score + Efficiency_Score + Head_Margin_Score + NPSH_Score - Speed_Penalty - Trim_Penalty
```

## Alternative Pump Suggestions

#### 3. Efficiency vs. Cost Trade-offs
Generate alternatives that:
- Higher efficiency but higher initial cost
- Lower efficiency but better availability
- Different speed options (2-pole vs 4-pole motors)

#### 4. Redundancy Considerations
Suggest configurations like:
- Multiple smaller pumps vs. single large pump
- Duty/standby arrangements
- Variable speed options for flexibility
