Calibrate BEP migration physics parameters against manufacturer data for optimal accuracy.

Enterprise-Grade Configuration Platform
settingsCurrent Calibration Factors
BEP Flow Exponent
1.2
Controls flow migration rate during impeller trimming

Formula: BEP_Q₂ = BEP_Q₁ × (D₂/D₁)^x
BEP Head Exponent
2.2
Controls head migration rate during impeller trimming

Formula: BEP_H₂ = BEP_H₁ × (D₂/D₁)^y
Efficiency Correction
0.1
Efficiency penalty factor for off-BEP operation

Formula: η_penalty = (|QBP - 100|) × z

Physics Guidelines & Effect Guide
Flow Exponent
BEP flow shift factor	1.0 - 2.0
↑ Higher = More flow shift during trimming
↓ Lower = Less flow shift during trimming
Head Exponent
Impeller diameter calculation	1.0 - 3.0
↑ Higher (2.5-3.0) = Smaller diameter changes
↓ Lower (1.0-1.5) = MAJOR diameter changes
Efficiency Factor
Power calculation impact	0.01 - 0.5
↑ Higher (0.3-0.5) = MAJOR power impact
↓ Lower (0.01-0.1) = Minimal power impact
Test Extreme Values
Head Exp: 1.2
Major impeller size changes

Head Exp: 2.8
Minimal impeller changes

Standard Values
Flow: 1.2
Balanced flow migration

Head: 2.0
Standard affinity law

Power Testing
Efficiency: 0.4
High power sensitivity

Efficiency: 0.05
Low power sensitivity
