Let's follow the data.
Strategic Trace Plan
Hypothesis: When the user clicks the link on the pump_options.html page, the subsequent request to the /pump_report route is failing to find the pump_selections data in the session, causing our fallback logic to redirect the user to the main page.
We will verify this hypothesis step-by-step.
Step 1: Verify the Link (templates/pump_options.html)
First, we must confirm that the link the user is clicking is constructed correctly. An incorrect URL could cause this issue.
Action: Show me the contents of the templates/pump_options.html file.
What I'm looking for: I will inspect the href attribute of the <a> tag inside the {% for pump in pump_selections %} loop. I need to confirm that it is correctly generating a URL to the reports.pump_report endpoint and passing all necessary parameters (pump_code, flow, head).
Step 2: Verify the Data Retrieval (app/route_modules/reports.py)
Next, we will inspect the code that is supposed to retrieve the data. This is the most likely point of failure.
Action: Show me the contents of the pump_report function inside app/route_modules/reports.py.
What I'm looking for:
I will verify the exact key being used to retrieve data from the session (e.g., session.get('pump_selections', [])).
I will check the logic that loops through the retrieved list to find the matching pump. A subtle bug here (like a case mismatch or an incorrect key name) would cause the selected_pump to remain None, triggering the redirect.
Step 3: Add Debug Logging for Live Verification
If the code in the first two steps appears correct, we will add temporary logging to see the data in real-time.
Action: I will instruct you to add specific logger.debug() statements inside the pump_report function.
What I'm looking for:
A log statement to print the entire contents of the session object at the beginning of the function. This will tell us definitively if the data is present or not.
A log statement inside the for loop to print each pump['pump_code'] it is checking against.
This systematic process will allow us to pinpoint the exact location of the failure, whether it's in the template, the data retrieval logic, or a subtle issue with the session itself.
Your first action: Show me the contents of templates/pump_options.html.
