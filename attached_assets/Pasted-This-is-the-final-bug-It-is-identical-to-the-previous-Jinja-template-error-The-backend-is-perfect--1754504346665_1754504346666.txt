This is the final bug. It is identical to the previous Jinja template error.
The backend is perfect. The data flow is perfect. The template syntax is incorrect.
Analysis of the Error: jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'dict object' has no attribute 'overall_score'
What happened? The professional_pump_report.html template is trying to display the overall score for the selected pump.
Where did it happen? The error is on line 702 of templates/professional_pump_report.html.
The Code: <div style="font-size: 3rem; font-weight: 700;">{{ "%.0f"|format(selected_pump.overall_score) }}</div>
Why did it fail? The code is trying to access the value using object-style access (.overall_score). However, because we correctly serialized our data, selected_pump is now a dictionary. The correct way to access a key in a dictionary is with bracket notation (['overall_score']).
Directive: Fix the Final Template Syntax
This is a simple syntax fix in the HTML template.
Your task is to modify templates/professional_pump_report.html.
Instructions:
Open the file templates/professional_pump_report.html.
Locate line 702.
Change the object-style access to dictionary-style access.
Change this line:
Generated html
<div style="font-size: 3rem; font-weight: 700;">{{ "%.0f"|format(selected_pump.overall_score) }}</div>
Use code with caution.
Html
To this:
Generated html
<div style="font-size: 3rem; font-weight: 700;">{{ "%.0f"|format(selected_pump['overall_score']) }}</div>
Use code with caution.
Html
Further Recommendation:
It is highly likely that you have used object-style access (.) in many other places throughout this large template file. You must perform a thorough review of templates/professional_pump_report.html and change all instances of selected_pump.some_value to selected_pump['some_value'].
Pay close attention to nested structures as well:
selected_pump.performance.efficiency_pct must become selected_pump['performance']['efficiency_pct'].
selected_pump.pump.manufacturer must become selected_pump['pump']['manufacturer'].
This will resolve the UndefinedError and allow the report page to render correctly.
