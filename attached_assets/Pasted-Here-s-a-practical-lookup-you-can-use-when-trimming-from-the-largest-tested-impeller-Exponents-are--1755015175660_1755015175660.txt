Here’s a practical lookup you can use when trimming from the largest tested impeller. Exponents are for the relations
Q \propto D^{x}, H \propto D^{y}, P \propto D^{z}. Also included: a rule-of-thumb NPSHr scaling \text{NPSHr} \propto D^{\alpha} and an expected efficiency drop near BEP after trimming.

Specific speed bands use the SI definition N_s=\dfrac{N\sqrt{Q}}{H^{3/4}} with N in rpm, Q in m³/s, H in m.

Recommended trim exponents by pump type & N_s band

Pump type (examples)	Typical N_s band (SI)	x (Flow)	y (Head)	z (Power)	\alpha (NPSHr)	BEP η drop (abs)
Radial – low N_s (end-suction, HSC; steeper H–Q)	10–30	1.00	1.98–2.05	2.95–3.05	~2.0	0.5–1.5 pts
Radial – mid N_s (end-suction/HSC; broader curve)	30–60	0.98–1.02	1.90–2.00	2.85–3.00	~1.9	0.8–2.0 pts
Vertical turbine – radial bowl (radial hydraulic)	20–50	1.00	1.95–2.00	2.9–3.0	~1.9–2.0	0.8–2.0 pts
Mixed-flow (incl. VT mixed-flow bowls)	60–120	0.95–1.00	1.80–1.90	2.70–2.90	~1.8	1.5–3.0 pts
Axial-flow (propeller)	120–220+	0.90–1.00	1.50–1.80	2.40–2.80	~1.6–1.8	2.0–4.0 pts
Multistage radial (BB3/BB5)	15–40 (per stage)	1.00	1.95–2.00	2.9–3.0	~2.0	0.8–2.0 pts
Slurry-duty radial (abrasive service)	20–50	0.95–1.00	1.85–1.95	2.7–2.9	~1.8–2.0	1.5–3.0 pts

How to use
	1.	Compute the diameter ratio r=D_2/D_1.
	2.	Pick the row that best matches your pump type and N_s band.
	3.	Scale: Q_2=Q_1\,r^{x}, H_2=H_1\,r^{y}, P_2=P_1\,r^{z}.
	4.	Adjust NPSHr: \text{NPSHr}_2=\text{NPSHr}_1\,r^{\alpha} (or re-read NPSHr vs the transformed flow if you have a curve).
	5.	Subtract the BEP efficiency drop shown (apply slightly larger off-BEP).
	6.	Re-intersect with your system curve and check NPSH margin & motor power.

Quick example

If a mixed-flow pump is trimmed from D_1 to D_2=0.92D_1 (so r=0.92), using x=0.98,\ y=1.86,\ z=2.8,\ \alpha=1.8:
	•	Q_2/Q_1 \approx 0.92^{0.98} \approx 0.92
	•	H_2/H_1 \approx 0.92^{1.86} \approx 0.84
	•	P_2/P_1 \approx 0.92^{2.8} \approx 0.78
	•	\text{NPSHr}_2/\text{NPSHr}_1 \approx 0.92^{1.8} \approx 0.84
	•	Expect ~2 points absolute drop in BEP efficiency.

If you’ve got a specific pump family, share its N_s (or the curve & duty) and I’ll pick the tightest exponents and run the numbers.
