This is a classic Jinja template rendering error, and it's happening for the exact reason I predicted in my last directive.
The backend is perfect. The data flow is perfect. The template syntax is incorrect.
Let's break down the new error.
Analysis of the Error: jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'dict object' has no attribute 'operating_point'
What happened? The professional_pump_report.html template is trying to access the operating_point attribute of the selected_pump variable.
Where did it happen? The error is on line 1331 of templates/professional_pump_report.html.
The Code: <span class="badge bg-success">{{ selected_pump.operating_point.efficiency_pct|round(1) }}%</span>
Why did it fail? The code is trying to use object-style access (.operating_point). However, because we correctly serialized our data, selected_pump is now a dictionary. It does not have an attribute named operating_point. It has a key named 'performance'.
The Root Cause: The data structure we saved to the session is:
Generated json
{
  "pump_code": "...",
  "suitability_score": 85.7,
  "performance": {
    "flow_m3hr": 25.0,
    "head_m": 46.0,
    "efficiency_pct": 61.9,
    ...
  },
  "pump": { ... }
}
Use code with caution.
Json
As you can see, the performance data is under the key 'performance', not 'operating_point'.
Final Directive: Fix All Template Syntax
This is the final bug. You must now perform a thorough review of the templates and fix all instances of incorrect data access.
Your task is to modify templates/professional_pump_report.html and templates/pump_options.html.
Instructions:
Open templates/professional_pump_report.html.
Search and Replace:
Find all instances of selected_pump.operating_point. Replace them with selected_pump.performance.
Find all instances of selected_pump.overall_score. Replace them with selected_pump.suitability_score.
After making those replacements, review the entire file and change all remaining object-style access (.) to dictionary-style access (['key']).
selected_pump.performance.efficiency_pct becomes selected_pump['performance']['efficiency_pct'].
selected_pump.pump_code becomes selected_pump['pump_code'].
selected_pump.pump.manufacturer becomes selected_pump['pump']['manufacturer'].
Open templates/pump_options.html.
Perform the same review and syntax correction. Change all object-style access (.) to dictionary-style access (['key']).
This systematic search and replace will fix all the UndefinedError exceptions and allow both pages to render correctly with the perfect data the backend is now providing.
This is the final step to complete the V6.0 implementation. Proceed.
