"Agent, this is fantastic progress! The UI screenshots show that many of BUGS from previous console logs have been fixed. Specifically:
Impeller Sizes are now displaying correctly for all pumps on the summary cards.
NPSH Required is correctly showing 'N/A' for pumps with no NPSH data ("6 K 6 VANE", "5 K") and the correct value for "6/8 ALE".
Power and Efficiency values on the summary cards look realistic and are no longer 0.0.
The interactive Plotly.js charts for "6/8 ALE" are rendering all three impeller curves for all four metrics (Head, Efficiency, Power, NPSH), which is a major achievement!
This means the Data Normalization, None Value Protection in templates, and the core data pipeline for the summary display are largely working.
Please focus on these next refinements:
Mark Operating Point on Interactive Charts:
Objective: Ensure the calculated operating point is visually marked on all four interactive Plotly.js charts.
Action: Review the /api/chart_data_safe endpoint in app/routes.py to ensure it correctly includes the full operating_point data (with all metrics: flow, head, eff, power, npshr, and extrapolation flags). Then, review static/js/charts.js to ensure this operating_point data is used to add a distinct marker trace to each of the four charts.
Resolve Power Discrepancy for "6/8 ALE" in Detailed Report:
Objective: Ensure the detailed report (professional_pump_report.html) for "6/8 ALE" shows the same dynamically calculated power (~112.1 kW) as the summary card, not the old hardcoded value (~31.1 kW).
Action: Remove the hardcoded operating point data for "6/8 ALE" from the /pump_report route in app/routes.py. Ensure this route uses the consistent, dynamically calculated data (likely from the session or by re-evaluating the pump) for all pumps when populating the context for professional_pump_report.html.
UI Indication for Extrapolated Values:
Objective: Clearly indicate to the user on the results/summary card page if any displayed operating point values for a pump were derived from extrapolation.
Action: Modify the template for the pump summary cards (e.g., pump_options.html). Use the *_was_extrapolated or operating_point_overall_extrapolated flags (passed from the backend) to add a visual cue (e.g., an asterisk *, a different text color, or a small icon with a tooltip: "Value is extrapolated and may be less accurate") next to any metric that was extrapolated.
Clarify/Remove "Performance Efficiency" Bar:
Objective: Avoid redundant information on summary cards.
Action: In the summary card template, if "Performance Efficiency" is simply repeating the main "Efficiency" value, please remove the "Performance Efficiency" bar and its label.
After these refinements, the application will be in an even stronger state. Great job tracking down those earlier critical issues!"
