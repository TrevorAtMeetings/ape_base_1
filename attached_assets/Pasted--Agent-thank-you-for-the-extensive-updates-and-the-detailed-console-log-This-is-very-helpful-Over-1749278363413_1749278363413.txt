"Agent, thank you for the extensive updates and the detailed console log. This is very helpful.
Overall Status:
The application starts, and the core Flask structure with routing seems to be in place.
The LLM module is initializing.
The new form submission to GET /pump-options and then redirect to /pump_report is a change in flow.
The Chart API endpoints (/api/chart_data/...) look well-implemented for Plotly.js.
Critical Issues to Address Next:
Robust Handling of Out-of-Range Flow & Interpolation Failures (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
In pump_engine.py (or app/performance_calculator.py):
Modify interpolate_value() to implement the 20% extrapolation margin. If flow is within this margin but outside the defined curve, use scipy.interpolate.interp1d with fill_value="extrapolate". Log a WARNING when extrapolation is used.
If flow is outside even the extrapolation limits, interpolate_value must return a clear failure indicator (e.g., None or an error dict).
calculate_operating_point() must check the result of every interpolation. If any essential metric (head, efficiency) fails even after attempted extrapolation, this function must return an object/dictionary clearly marking an error for that operating point (e.g., {'error': 'Operating point indeterminate', 'achieved_head_m': None, ...}).
In pump_engine.py (or app/selection_engine.py - specifically find_best_pumps and its helper analysis functions like _analyze_bep_operation, generate_reasoning_text, etc.):
When an operating_point is retrieved for a pump/curve, rigorously check if it's valid (no error flag, essential metrics are not None) before attempting any detailed analysis (BEP, NPSH, Power) or calling any LLM reasoning functions.
If the operating point is invalid, that pump/curve is unsuitable. Assign it a very low score or filter it out. Do not pass invalid/incomplete operating point data to LLM functions or other detailed analysis functions. This will prevent the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get' errors.
Static Chart Generation (generate_pump_charts in app/routes.py):
This function must be updated to plot actual pump curve data.
It should take parsed_pump_obj (which contains parsed_pump_obj.curves).
For the selected curve (e.g., parsed_pump_obj.curves[operating_point['curve_index']]), extract the flow_vs_head, flow_vs_efficiency, flow_vs_power, and flow_vs_npshr data.
Plot these actual data series using Matplotlib.
Clearly mark the operating_point (passed to the function) on each chart.
Generate all four charts (Head, Efficiency, Power, NPSH) and return their paths in the charts dictionary.
Template Data Consistency (pump_report route & professional_pump_report.html):
The jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'dict object' has no attribute 'flow_m3hr' (from previous logs when rendering the report template) needs to be definitively fixed.
Ensure the data structure passed as selected_pump (or equivalent) to professional_pump_report.html is consistent, and the template accesses its attributes/keys correctly (e.g., selected_pump.operating_point['achieved_flow_m3hr'] if operating_point is a dictionary within the selected_pump dictionary).
Remove the hardcoded data for '6/8 ALE' in the pump_report route once the calculation engine and data passing are robust.
Review Import Strategy & pump_engine.py Consolidation:
In app/routes.py, there are duplicate-seeming imports:
from pump_engine import load_all_pump_data, parse_pump_data, find_best_pumps, ...
from .utils import load_all_pump_data as utils_load_data
# ... etc.
Use code with caution.
Python
Please clarify and unify this. If pump_engine.py is the consolidated source of truth for all this logic, then app/routes.py (and other modules) should only import from pump_engine. The separate app/utils.py, app/pump_parser.py, app/selection_engine.py files might then become redundant or internal components used by pump_engine.py. Let's ensure a single, clear source for these core functions.
Focus Order for the Agent:
Fix extrapolation and robust None handling in performance_calculator and selection_engine to prevent AttributeErrors and ensure only valid operating points proceed to detailed analysis/LLM.
Fix static chart generation in generate_pump_charts to use real data.
Fix any remaining template data access issues in professional_pump_report.html.
Clarify/unify the import strategy regarding pump_engine.py vs. individual modules.
After these are addressed, we can more confidently test the LLM reasoning and the overall workflow."
