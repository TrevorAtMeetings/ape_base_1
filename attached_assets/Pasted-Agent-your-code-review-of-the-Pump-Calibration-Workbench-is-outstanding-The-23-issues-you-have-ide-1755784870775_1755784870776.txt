Agent, your code review of the Pump Calibration Workbench is outstanding. The 23 issues you have identified are all valid and important. Your analysis is precise, and your recommendations are excellent.
We will now proceed with fixing the most critical issues you found. Please implement the "High Priority (Security & Correct
ness)" recommendations from your report.
Your task is to perform the following four fixes:
1. Implement Input Validation and Sanitization:
File: app/route_modules/brain_admin.py
Action: In the /run-calibration route, add robust server-side validation for all data received from the form.
Sanitize the pump_code to prevent injection attacks.
Use try-except blocks to safely cast flow, head, and other numerical inputs to floats.
Validate that these numbers are within a reasonable range (e.g., not negative).
2. Add CSRF Protection:
File: templates/admin/pump_calibration.html and app/route_modules/brain_admin.py.
Action:
First, ensure that our Flask application has the Flask-WTF library and a SECRET_KEY configured.
In the template, add the hidden CSRF token field to the form: {{ form.csrf_token }}.
In the backend route, you will need to integrate a FlaskForm to handle the form submission and its validation, which will automatically handle the CSRF check.
3. Fix the Pump Repository Instantiation:
File: app/route_modules/brain_admin.py
Action: In the ManufacturerComparisonEngine, remove the inefficient PumpRepository() instantiation inside the loop. Instead, use the get_pump_repository() singleton pattern at the module level or pass the repository in as a dependency, as you recommended.
4. Correct the overall_accuracy Calculation:
File: app/route_modules/brain_admin.py
Action: In the ManufacturerComparisonEngine, find the overall_accuracy calculation. Replace the flawed logic with your improved recommendation: overall_accuracy = 100 - np.mean([abs(d) for d in efficiency_deltas + power_deltas]).
Please proceed with implementing these four high-priority fixes. This will make our new feature significantly more secure, robust, and correct.
