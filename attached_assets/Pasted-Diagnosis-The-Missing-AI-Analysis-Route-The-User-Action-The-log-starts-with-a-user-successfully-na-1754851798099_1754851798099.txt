Diagnosis: The Missing AI Analysis Route
The User Action: The log starts with a user successfully navigating to a pump report page via a direct search:
GET /pump_report/200-200-430%204P?flow=350&head=50&direct_search=true HTTP/1.1" 200 -
This is great. It means the report page itself is loading correctly.
The "Smoking Gun" (The Critical Log Line):
INFO:werkzeug:10.81.1.78 - - [10/Aug/2025 18:46:41] "POST /api/ai_analysis_fast HTTP/1.1" 404 -
Analysis:
After the report page loads, a script on that page (likely in charts.js or a similar file) makes a POST request to /api/ai_analysis_fast to fetch the AI-generated text for the report.
The server responds with a 404 - status code. This is an unambiguous error that means "I could not find any route that matches this URL and method."
This is not a bug inside the AI analysis logic itself. The code for the function isn't even being reached. The problem is that the Flask application's routing layer does not recognize this endpoint.
The Root Cause:
There are two highly likely causes for this 404 error:
Cause A (Most Likely): The ai_analysis_fast function in app/route_modules/api.py is registered with the wrong decorator. It's likely using @app.route(...) instead of @api_bp.route(...). When a function is decorated with @app.route, it's attached directly to the main app, but if the api_bp blueprint has a URL prefix (like /api), the final URL will be incorrect.
Cause B (Less Likely): There's a simple typo in either the route definition in the Python code or the URL being called by the JavaScript.
Action Plan: Fix the Route Registration
We need to inspect the api.py file and ensure the route is correctly defined and registered with the correct blueprint.
Step 1: Inspect the Route Definition
File to check: app/route_modules/api.py
Action: Find the ai_analysis_fast function.
Likely Incorrect Code in api.py:
code
Python
# In app/route_modules/api.py

# ...
api_bp = Blueprint('api', __name__, url_prefix='/api') # Let's assume the prefix is /api

# ... other routes using @api_bp.route ...

# THIS IS THE LIKELY BUG
@app.route('/api/ai_analysis_fast', methods=['POST']) # Using @app.route instead of @api_bp.route
def ai_analysis_fast():
    # ...
If the blueprint is defined as api_bp = Blueprint('api', __name__) (without a prefix), and the decorator is @app.route('/api/ai_analysis_fast'), this is also incorrect as it circumvents the blueprint.
Step 2: Implement the Fix
The fix is to ensure the route is registered correctly on the api_bp blueprint.
Corrected Code in api.py:
code
Python
# In app/route_modules/api.py

# ...
# The blueprint should handle the /api prefix
api_bp = Blueprint('api', __name__, url_prefix='/api')

# ...

# CORRECTED DECORATOR
@api_bp.route('/ai_analysis_fast', methods=['POST']) # Use the blueprint and remove the /api prefix
def ai_analysis_fast():
    # ...
This change ensures that Flask correctly maps the incoming POST request for /api/ai_analysis_fast to the ai_analysis_fast function.
Summary for the Agent
Agent, the logs show that the report page is loading, but the subsequent POST request to /api/ai_analysis_fast is failing with a 404 Not Found error.
This indicates that the route is not correctly registered with the Flask application.
Your task is to:
Open the file app/route_modules/api.py.
Locate the ai_analysis_fast function.
Verify its route decorator. It is likely using @app.route(...) incorrectly.
Change the decorator to @api_bp.route('/ai_analysis_fast', methods=['POST']) to correctly register it with the api_bp blueprint.
Ensure that the blueprint itself (api_bp) is defined with a url_prefix='/api' if that is the intended structure. If the blueprint has no prefix, the route should be @api_bp.route('/api/ai_analysis_fast', ...).
This will fix the 404 error and allow the AI analysis content to be loaded on the report page.
