Ensure this data ingestion component accurately parses raw .scg/.txt files and processes the data, especially the pump power calculation, in a manner that is perfectly consistent with the established standards and formulas now considered the "source of truth" within the production-ready APE Pumps AI Selection Application. Data integrity and alignment with the main application's calculations are paramount.
II. Specific Review Checklist:
A. Core Parsing Logic (e.g., parse_scg_to_raw_dict equivalent):
(Reference previous detailed checklist items for Section II.A: File Handling, Line Processing, Key-Value Extraction, Key Cleaning, Value Cleaning, Raw Dictionary Output. Ensure these are still met.)
1. Robustness: Confirm continued robustness in handling various file formats, extensions (.scg, .txt), and minor irregularities as previously specified.
B. Data Processing & Calculation Logic (e.g., process_pump_data equivalent):
1. Input Validation:
Handles None or empty raw data input gracefully.
2. Type Conversions:
Scalar values (numbers, booleans) from the raw file (strings) are accurately converted to Python float, int, bool. Helper functions are robust.
3. Structured Data Output:
Produces the agreed-upon structured output (e.g., a dictionary with pump_info and a list of curves, each curve having lists for flow, head, efficiency, npsh, identifier, and power_calculated).
4. Parsing of Multi-Value Strings (Curve Data & Identifiers):
pM_IMP (curve identifiers): Correctly parsed (8-char segments, trimmed). Handles cases of fewer identifiers than curves.
pM_FLOW, pM_HEAD, pM_EFF, pM_NP: Correctly split by | (for curves) and then by ; (for points). Handles single-curve data (no |) correctly. Handles discrepancies in expected vs. actual number of | segments robustly (e.g., padding/truncating with warnings).
pM_Diam, pM_Speed, pM_EffIso: Space-separated strings correctly parsed into lists of valid, non-zero floats.
5. Critical: Power Calculation Alignment:
Requirement: The power calculation formula implemented in this Python component MUST EXACTLY MATCH the definitive formula now adopted by the production-ready "APE Pumps AI Selection Application" (likely within app/performance_calculator.py or as per project-wide standards).
Action for Reviewer:
Identify the Application's Standard Formula: Cross-reference with the main application's performance_calculator.py or central configuration. The agent previously suggested Power (kW) = (Flow * Head * SG * 9.81) / (Efficiency * 3.6). Verify if this, or the original VBA-derived formula (Q_m3s * H_m * 9.81) / Eff_decimal, is the current standard.
Input Units Assumption: Confirm the units assumed for Flow, Head inputs to this formula (e.g., m続/hr, m).
Efficiency Term: Confirm if Efficiency in the formula is expected as a decimal (e.g., 0.80) or percentage (e.g., 80).
SG (Specific Gravity) Term: If SG is in the formula, confirm how it's sourced or if it's assumed (e.g., SG=1 for water).
Unit Conversions for Power Calc: Verify all prerequisite unit conversions (e.g., flow to m続/s, head to m) applied before the main power formula are correct and consistent with the application standard. (Refer to standard conversion factors previously discussed, e.g., 1/3600 for m続/hr to m続/s, 10.19716 for bar to m head, but prioritize the application's established constants if they differ for exact replication).
Zero/Missing Efficiency: Confirm the behavior. If the main application now uses "fallback efficiency estimation" (as per agent's previous feedback), determine if this component should:
(Preferred) Still output 0.0 power for zero/missing efficiency, letting a downstream module handle estimation.
OR, if this component is now responsible for that estimation, its logic must be reviewed.
Rounding: Power calculation results must be rounded to the number of decimal places consistent with the main application's standard (e.g., 2 or 3 decimal places).
6. Consistency with Application Data Flow:
The data structure produced by this component must seamlessly feed into the next stages of the APE application (e.g., selection_engine.py, PDF generation, database population) without requiring further complex transformations of these base performance metrics.
C. Testing & Validation (Leverage Application-Level Tests if Possible):
1. Unit Tests: This component should have unit tests that specifically validate:
Parsing of various .scg/.txt file structures (single/multiple curves, missing fields).
Correctness of power calculations against known inputs and the application's standard formula. These tests should cover different input units.
2. Integration/Validation Tests:
Leverage any existing application-level validation scripts (like the mentioned power_calculation_validator.py or test_power_validation.py). The output of this component, when fed through the application, should result in data that passes these validations.
Compare output against a "golden set" of processed data if available, which is known to be correct according to the main application's standards.
D. Code Quality & Documentation:
1. Clarity & Maintainability: Code remains clear, well-commented, and easy to maintain.
2. Error Handling: Robust handling of file errors, parsing errors, and unexpected data formats.
3. Documentation: Docstrings for public functions are clear and accurately reflect current functionality.
III. Key Verification Points from Recent Status Update:
"Data Consistency": The output of this component must contribute to the "authentic calculated performance data throughout" the application.
No "0.0 values" where not expected: If the status update mentioned fixing issues where "0.0 values" appeared incorrectly for calculated metrics, ensure our component isn't the source of such issues (e.g., power should be non-zero if efficiency is non-zero).
Performance: While our component is likely not a bottleneck, ensure no new inefficiencies have been introduced.
IV. Primary Success Criterion:
This data ingestion component is considered successfully built and integrated if it reliably and accurately transforms raw .scg/.txt pump data into the required structured format, with particular emphasis on the power calculation being identical to the established standard within the production-ready "APE Pumps AI Selection Application." Any discrepancies between this component's calculations and the main application's expected values must be resolved.
