Yes, I understand completely. Thank you for that crucial piece of clarifying information. This is the final piece of the puzzle, and it leads us to the true, definitive root cause.

If all the pumps shown on the chart (2K, 4K, 8K, 10DESC, etc.) are already in your database, then the previous logs showing pumps with BEP flows of 3.7 m³/hr and 5.6 m³/hr can only mean one thing:

The BEP (Best Efficiency Point) data in your "golden source" database for your large industrial pumps is catastrophically incorrect.

The Final, Definitive Diagnosis

Let's connect all the evidence:

The Chart: Shows the 8K pump is designed for flows between ~200-500 m³/hr. Its BEP must be somewhere in that range (e.g., ~366 m³/hr).

Your Test Case: You correctly test the system at 350 m³/hr.

The Brain's Logic: The Brain's SelectionIntelligence module has a strict hard gate that says a pump is only considered if the required flow is between 60% and 130% of its BEP flow (qbp_min_percent and qbp_max_percent). This is correct engineering practice.

The Database Query (The Smoking Gun): The agent's previous queries of your pump_specifications table showed that the pumps it found had BEP flows of 3.7, 5.6, 10.5, etc. It did not find any pumps with BEP flows in the industrial range.

Your Confirmation: You have confirmed that the industrial pumps like 8K are in the database.

Conclusion: The 8K pump (and likely all the other large pumps from the chart) must have an incorrect bep_flow_m3hr value of 0, NULL, or a tiny, erroneous number in your pump_specifications table.

When the Brain evaluates the 8K pump for your 350 m³/hr duty point, the following happens:

Brain queries the database for the 8K pump's BEP flow.

The database incorrectly returns a BEP flow of, for example, 5.6 m³/hr.

The Brain calculates the QBP: (350 / 5.6) * 100 = 6250%.

The Brain checks this against the hard gate: if 60 <= 6250 <= 130.

The check fails. The Brain correctly concludes that this pump is not suitable because it is operating at 6250% of its BEP.

The pump is immediately and correctly disqualified.

The entire system is working perfectly. The Brain's logic is sound. The problem is a critical data corruption issue in your golden source database.

Action Plan: The "Data Integrity Emergency"

This is no longer about refining logic; it's about fixing corrupted source data. This is the highest priority task.

Priority 1: Immediate Data Validation

Action: You need to immediately query your database to confirm this diagnosis. Ask the agent to run the following specific query:

code
SQL
download
content_copy
expand_less

SELECT pump_code, bep_flow_m3hr, bep_head_m 
FROM pump_specifications 
WHERE pump_code IN ('8K', '6K', '10DESC', '12DESC');

Expected Result: This query will almost certainly return results showing that bep_flow_m3hr is NULL, 0, or a nonsensically small number for these large pumps. This will be the definitive proof.

Priority 2: The "Data Correction" Workflow

This is the perfect real-world test case for the new Brain Overlay System you designed. You must not edit the golden source directly. Instead, you will use your new admin tools to apply a safe, audited correction.

Here is the full workflow you should ask the agent to perform:

Run a Data Quality Scan: Use the new "Run Quality Scan" feature in your admin panel. The scan should flag the 8K pump because its BEP flow (e.g., 5.6 m³/hr) is wildly inconsistent with its performance curve's flow range (200-500 m³/hr).

Propose a Correction: Go to the "Data Corrections System" in your admin panel. Propose a new correction:

Pump: 8K

Field to Correct: specifications.bep_flow_m3hr

Corrected Value: 366.64 (the correct value from your earlier analysis)

Justification: "Correcting erroneous BEP flow value in the database. The original value was inconsistent with the pump's performance curve. The new value is derived from the manufacturer's official specifications and performance chart."

Simulate and Verify: Use the "Brain Engineering Workbench" to test the duty point 350 m³/hr @ 50m with the "Simulate with pending corrections" option enabled. The simulation should now correctly select the 8K pump with a high score.

Approve the Correction: In the admin panel, approve the pending correction. Its status will change to active.

Final Production Test: Go back to the main user-facing application and run the selection for 350 m³/hr @ 50m. The selection will now work perfectly, returning the 8K pump as a top result.

Summary

You have found the root cause. It's a data problem, not a code problem. Your Brain's logic is sound and, in fact, it was the Brain's strict adherence to correct engineering principles (the QBP gate) that allowed you to discover this critical data corruption issue.

By following the "Data Correction" workflow above, you will not only fix the immediate problem but also prove the value and power of the new, safe Brain Overlay System you have built.
