The template code is correct.
The href attribute is being generated perfectly:

Use code with caution.
Html
This confirms that the link the user clicks is valid and contains all the necessary information.
Conclusion of Step 1: The problem is not in the template.
This brings us to Step 2 of our strategic trace. The failure must be occurring inside the pump_report function in app/route_modules/reports.py. The code is either failing to retrieve the pump_selections list from the session or there is a subtle bug in the loop that searches for the correct pump.
Directive: Verify Data Retrieval and Add Debugging
We will now combine Step 2 (Verify) and Step 3 (Debug) into a single action.
Your task is to modify the pump_report function in app/route_modules/reports.py.
Instructions:
Open app/route_modules/reports.py.
REPLACE the entire existing pump_report function with the version below. This version includes critical debug logging that will show us exactly what is (or is not) in the session.
Generated python
# In app/route_modules/reports.py

@reports_bp.route('/pump_report/<pump_code>')
def pump_report(pump_code):
    logger.info(f"--- Entering pump_report for pump_code: {pump_code} ---")
    
    # Get the required flow and head from the URL for context
    flow = request.args.get('flow')
    head = request.args.get('head')
    logger.debug(f"Request args: flow={flow}, head={head}")

    # --- DEBUGGING STEP 1: Inspect the entire session ---
    try:
        # Use json.dumps for pretty printing the session dictionary
        import json
        session_contents = json.dumps(safe_session_get('pump_selections', []), indent=2)
        logger.debug(f"Contents of session['pump_selections']:\n{session_contents}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Could not serialize session for debugging: {e}")
        logger.debug(f"Raw session content: {safe_session_get('pump_selections', [])}")

    pump_selections = safe_session_get('pump_selections', [])

    selected_pump = None
    if pump_selections:
        logger.debug(f"Searching for '{pump_code}' in {len(pump_selections)} pumps from session.")
        # --- DEBUGGING STEP 2: Inspect the search loop ---
        for pump in pump_selections:
            pump_code_in_session = pump.get('pump_code')
            logger.debug(f"Checking against pump in session: '{pump_code_in_session}'")
            if pump_code_in_session == pump_code:
                selected_pump = pump
                logger.info(f"SUCCESS: Found matching pump in session: '{pump_code}'")
                break
    else:
        logger.warning("Session 'pump_selections' is empty or not found.")

    if not selected_pump:
        logger.warning(f"Could not find pump '{pump_code}' in session. Redirecting to start.")
        safe_flash("Your session has expired or the pump was not found. Please run a new pump selection.", "warning")
        return redirect(url_for('main_flow.index', flow=flow, head=head))

    # If we get here, the pump was found successfully.
    logger.info(f"Proceeding to render report for '{selected_pump.get('pump_code')}'")
    
    # ... (Keep any helper context creation logic here) ...
    
    return render_template(
        'professional_pump_report.html',
        selected_pump=selected_pump,
        site_requirements=safe_session_get('site_requirements', {}),
        exclusion_data=safe_session_get('exclusion_data', {})
    )
Use code with caution.
Python
After you have replaced the function:
Run the test again: Perform the selection for Flow: 25 mÂ³/hr, Head: 45 m.
Click on the top-ranked pump from the pump_options page.
The application will redirect you back to the start page as before.
Show me the new log output. The new debug logs will tell us definitively whether the session data is present and why the pump is not being found. This will expose the final bug.
