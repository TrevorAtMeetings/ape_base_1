Agent, your report on the capabilities of the existing Brain Logic Workbench is excellent. It confirms that you have successfully built a powerful tool for analyzing the Brain's internal logic.
Now, we will complete this feature by adding the final component: Ground Truth Calibration. This will allow engineers to compare the Brain's predictions directly against manufacturer datasheets.
Your task is to enhance the existing Brain Logic Workbench by adding this new functionality.
Step 1: Enhance the Workbench UI (brain_workbench.html)
Open: app/templates/admin/brain_workbench.html.
Action: Add a new "Ground Truth Calibration" card to the UI. This card should be placed alongside the existing "Pump Testing" and "Selection Simulation" tools.
Content of the new card:
It must contain a form that allows an engineer to input the following "ground truth" data from a manufacturer's datasheet:
Pump Code
Duty Flow and Duty Head
The manufacturer's stated Trimmed Impeller Ø
The manufacturer's stated Efficiency at that duty point.
The manufacturer's stated Power Absorbed at that duty point.
The form should submit this data via a POST request to a new backend route.
Step 2: Create the New Backend Route for Calibration
File to modify: The appropriate admin routes file (e.g., app/route_modules/admin_routes.py).
Action: Create a new route, for example, /admin/brain-workbench/run-calibration.
Logic for the new route:
It must be protected by your admin authentication.
It will receive the ground truth data from the form.
It will then call the Brain's performance.calculate_at_point method for the same pump and duty point to get the Brain's own prediction.
It will then calculate the deltas (differences) between the ground truth and the Brain's prediction for each parameter.
Finally, it will re-render the same brain_workbench.html template, passing back all the data needed to display a new "Calibration Results" section.
Step 3: Add the Results Display to the Workbench UI
File to modify: app/templates/admin/brain_workbench.html.
Action: Add a new section to the template that only displays if calibration_results are present.
Content of the results section:
A clear, formatted table that shows a side-by-side comparison.
Columns: "Parameter," "Manufacturer (Truth)," "Brain Prediction," and "Delta (%)".
Rows: "Trimmed Impeller Ø," "Efficiency," and "Power."
The "Delta (%)" column should be color-coded to instantly show the accuracy (e.g., green for <2%, orange for 2-5%, red for >5%).
This final enhancement will complete the Brain Logic Workbench, transforming it into a comprehensive tool for both analyzing the Brain's logic and calibrating its accuracy against real-world data.
