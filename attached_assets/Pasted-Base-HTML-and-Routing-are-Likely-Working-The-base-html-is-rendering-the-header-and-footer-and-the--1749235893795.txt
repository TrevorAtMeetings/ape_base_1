Base HTML and Routing are Likely Working: The base.html is rendering the header and footer, and the route to input_form.html is functional. The introductory panel is also showing.
Form Sections Hidden by Default (or Error): The actual form input sections (<div class="row section-card" id="core-requirements-section">, etc.) are not being displayed. This is almost certainly due to:
Overly Aggressive JavaScript: The progressive reveal JavaScript (in static/js/main.js before the fix) was likely hiding all sections by default and failing to show the first one, or an error in the JS prevented any section from being shown.
CSS Hiding Sections: There might be CSS rules (perhaps intended for the progressive reveal) that are hiding these sections by default, and the JS isn't correctly overriding them.
The Agent's Proposed Fixes Should Address This Directly:
By "removing problematic progressive reveal logic" from static/js/main.js, the JavaScript that was erroneously hiding everything should no longer be active.
By "adding CSS !important rules to keep sections visible" in static/css/style.css and "section stability classes" in templates/input_form.html, the agent is trying to force the sections to be visible by default, overriding any problematic JS or conflicting CSS.
Next Steps for the Agent (and your verification):
Apply the Fixes: Ensure the agent has applied the changes to:
static/js/main.js (simplifying or removing the faulty progressive reveal JS)
static/css/style.css (adding styles to ensure section visibility)
templates/input_form.html (potentially adding classes that the new CSS targets)
Test input_form.html Again:
After the fixes, reload the input_form.html page.
Expected Outcome: All form sections (Core Requirements, Contact, Application, Liquid, System, Motor) should now be visible on the page by default. The page will be longer, but everything should be there.
Verify Functionality:
Can you type into the input fields?
Do the dropdowns work?
Does the "Reset Form" button work (and reinitialize Materialize selects as per its JS)?
Can you submit the form?
If the form sections are still missing after the agent says it has applied the fixes:
Ask the Agent to show the updated static/js/main.js: Specifically, what parts of the progressive reveal logic were removed or changed.
Ask the Agent to show the new CSS rules in static/css/style.css that are intended to make the sections visible.
Ask the Agent to show the relevant parts of templates/input_form.html to see if any new classes were added or if there's anything obviously still hiding the content (e.g., inline style="display:none;" that wasn't removed).
Check Browser Developer Tools: Manually inspect the HTML elements for the form sections. See what CSS rules are being applied and if any display: none; rule is active. This can help pinpoint if it's a CSS or JS issue.
The agent is on the right track by identifying this as a JS/CSS visibility problem. The key is to ensure its fixes effectively make the form content display as intended for this iteration (which is likely all sections visible by default for now).
