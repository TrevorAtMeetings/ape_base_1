Key Observations (Same as Before, Underscoring the Problem):
Successful Startup: The application starts, LLM modules initialize.
Extrapolation Warnings Triggered:
WARNING:pump_engine:Extrapolating value for x=342.0 (original range: 10.0-309.0, with 20% margin: -49.8-368.8)
This confirms the target flow 342.0 is outside the original curve range for at least one curve of one pump, but within the 20% extrapolation margin. So, interpolate_value should be attempting to extrapolate.
CRITICAL ERROR Persists:
ERROR:app.routes:Error in pump_options: must be real number, not NoneType
This error occurs after the extrapolation warnings.
The application then redirects to the index page (INFO:app.routes:Index route accessed. at the end).
Analysis of Why the Fixes Might Have Failed (Hypotheses):
Even if the agent was instructed to add None checks, the TypeError can still occur if:
interpolate_value Still Returns None Unexpectedly:
Despite the intention to extrapolate, scipy.interpolate.interp1d (if fill_value is not set to "extrapolate" or if the Scipy version behaves differently) or the manual _linear_interpolate might still return None if the extrapolation is problematic or hits an edge case within the 20% margin (e.g., curve data is too sparse at the ends).
If interpolate_value returns None, then calculate_operating_point will likely pass this None along for head, efficiency, power, or NPSHr.
Incomplete None Checks in Scoring/Evaluation Logic:
The None checks might have been added in some places but missed in others within the complex chain of functions called by /pump-options (which includes find_best_pumps, evaluate_pump_for_requirements, calculate_pump_suitability_score, and all the _analyze_... functions in pump_engine.py).
A single missed check where a None value is used in a sum, multiplication, division, or passed to a function like float() or abs() will trigger the TypeError.
Defaulting None to 0 (Zero) Incorrectly:
If a None value from interpolation was defaulted to 0.0 too early (e.g., for efficiency), this 0.0 could then cause a ZeroDivisionError in the power calculation (Power = ... / efficiency_decimal), which might then be caught by a generic except Exception and perhaps lead to a None being returned for power, which then causes the TypeError later.
Urgent Next Steps & Instructions for the Agent (More Prescriptive):
The agent needs to be extremely methodical in tracing where None is originating and ensuring every single numerical operation is safeguarded.
"Agent, the TypeError: must be real number, not NoneType in the /pump-options route persists even after the extrapolation warnings, indicating that None values are still reaching numerical operations.
We need a more rigorous approach to identify and handle this.
Task: Resolve TypeError by Bulletproofing None Handling in pump_engine.py
Verify interpolate_value Output (in pump_engine.py or performance_calculator.py):
Action: Temporarily modify interpolate_value to always log its target_x, the x_values range, and the result it's about to return, especially if the result is None or if extrapolation was attempted.
Action: Ensure that if scipy.interpolate.interp1d is used with fill_value="extrapolate", it's working as expected for values within the 20% margin. If it's still returning NaN or something that becomes None, the fallback to _linear_interpolate or another handling method is critical.
Goal: Confirm interpolate_value itself is not the primary source of unexpected Nones when extrapolation should be possible.
Bulletproof calculate_operating_point (in pump_engine.py):
Action: This function is CRITICAL. Before returning the operating_point dictionary:
For each key metric (achieved_head_m, achieved_efficiency_pct, achieved_power_kw, achieved_npshr_m):
Check if its value is None.
If it is None, log a specific warning (e.g., logger.warning(f"Metric 'achieved_head_m' is None for pump {parsed_pump.pump_code} at flow {target_flow}")).
For the purpose of preventing TypeError downstream, if a metric is None, explicitly set it to 0.0 (or a very small non-zero number if division by it is expected later, like for efficiency) within this function's return dictionary AND add a flag like 'head_calculation_failed': True.
Example:
# Inside calculate_operating_point
op_point_dict = { ... } # your current dict
if op_point_dict['achieved_head_m'] is None:
    logger.warning(f"Head is None for {parsed_pump.pump_code}, curve {curve_index}, flow {target_flow}. Defaulting to 0.0.")
    op_point_dict['achieved_head_m'] = 0.0
    op_point_dict['head_calculation_failed'] = True # Add flag
# Repeat for efficiency, power, npshr
return op_point_dict
Use code with caution.
Python
Goal: Ensure calculate_operating_point never returns None for the core numerical metrics that will be used in math operations later. Instead, it returns 0.0 (or a safe default) and flags that the calculation failed.
Review All Scoring and Analysis Functions in pump_engine.py:
Action: Systematically go through evaluate_pump_for_requirements, find_best_curve_for_duty, calculate_pump_suitability_score, and all _analyze_... functions.
For every single mathematical operation (+, -, *, /, abs(), float(), etc.) or any function that expects a number:
Check if any of its operands (input variables) could have come from an operating_point metric.
Before the operation, explicitly check if those operands are None.
If an operand is None (which shouldn't happen if step 2 above is done correctly, but as a safeguard):
Log a warning.
Assign a default value (e.g., 0.0) to that operand before the operation.
Or, structure the logic to skip that part of the score if data is missing (e.g., if achieved_efficiency is not None and achieved_efficiency > 0: power_score = ... else: power_score = -50 # Penalty).
Example (in scoring):
achieved_head = operating_point.get('achieved_head_m', 0.0) # Default to 0.0 if key missing
if achieved_head is None: # Explicit check even after .get() with default
    achieved_head = 0.0
    logger.warning("achieved_head was None in scoring, defaulted to 0.0")

# Ensure target_head is also a number
if target_head is None or target_head == 0: # Avoid division by zero
     head_accuracy = 0
else:
     head_accuracy = max(0, 100 - abs(achieved_head - target_head) / target_head * 100)
Use code with caution.
Python
Goal: Eliminate any possibility of a None value being passed to a numerical operation.
Test with the Failing Case:
Action: After these changes, run the application and submit the form with Flow=342, Head=27.4 again.
Expected Outcome: The TypeError should be gone. The application should proceed to render the /pump-options page (or redirect to /pump_report if that's the flow now).
The console logs will be very important to see which values were defaulted due to None.
The displayed results might still show 0.0 for power/NPSH if the underlying data or interpolation logic for those specific metrics is still problematic, but the application shouldn't crash with a TypeError.
Report Back:
"Agent, after implementing these robust None checks and default value assignments (with logging) at every stage from interpolate_value through all scoring and analysis functions in pump_engine.py:
Confirm if the TypeError: must be real number, not NoneType in the /pump-options route is resolved.
Share the console logs for the Flow=342, Head=27.4 test case, particularly any warnings about None values being defaulted.
Describe what is now displayed on the results page for this test case (Power, NPSH, Impeller, Score, BEP Distance)."
