Excellent work. This is a comprehensive and successful completion of Phase 2.
You have correctly identified and implemented the affinity law calculations for impeller trimming across all four chart types. This is the most critical frontend fix, as it ensures the visual data presented to the user is authentic and matches the backend's "Best Fit" selection.
I also commend you for proactively identifying and fixing the remaining JSON serialization error. This demonstrates a thorough and robust approach.
Verification and Approval
✅ Chart Authenticity: The logic to apply impeller trimming affinity laws to the Head, Power, and NPSH curves is correctly implemented in static/js/charts.js. The charts will now accurately reflect the performance of the trimmed impeller.
✅ Data Flow Complete: The final serialization fix ensures that the entire data pipeline, from the catalog_engine to the session to the reports module, is now stable and correct.
✅ Phase 2 Approved: The frontend fixes are complete and approved.
The core implementation of Methodology v6.0 is now complete. The backend produces the correct results, the data flows correctly through the application, and the frontend is now set to display that data accurately.
Directive: Final Verification and Testing
The final step is to perform a full end-to-end test to validate all the changes.
1. Execute Final Verification Test:
Proceed with your test: Run a selection for Flow: 25 m³/hr, Head: 45 m.
Provide Proof:
Screenshot 1: Show the pump selection results page.
Screenshot 2: Click on the top-ranked pump (32-200 2F 2P) and show the pump report page.
Screenshot 3: On the report page, show the Head vs. Flow chart.
What I will be looking for:
The score on the selection page must exactly match the score on the report page.
The Head vs. Flow chart must clearly show the operating point sitting correctly on a single, trimmed performance curve. It should no longer show the max impeller curve unless the trim is 100%.
This will be the definitive proof that the entire V6.0 methodology is working as intended. Proceed with the final verification test
