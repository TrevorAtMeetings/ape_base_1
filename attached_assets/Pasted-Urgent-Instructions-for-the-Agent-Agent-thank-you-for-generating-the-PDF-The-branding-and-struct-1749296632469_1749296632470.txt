Urgent Instructions for the Agent:
"Agent, thank you for generating the PDF. The branding and structure are excellent.
However, the PDF content for '6/8 ALE' (and '5 K' previously) shows critical data issues:
Performance Metrics are 0.0: Operating Head, Efficiency, Power, and NPSHr are all displayed as 0.0 in the text, tables, and analysis sections. This is incorrect; for Flow=342, Head=27.4, '6/8 ALE' should have ~82% Eff, ~112kW Power, ~2.8m NPSHr, and ~27.4m Achieved Head.
Charts are Blank: Performance charts are not rendering.
This indicates that the selected_evaluation object being used by the PDF generation logic (in the /generate_pdf/<pump_code> route and any functions it calls like pdf_generator.generate_pdf) contains an operating_point dictionary with these incorrect zero values. This is happening even if the /pump-options route calculated correct values previously.
Please perform the following CRITICAL debugging for the PDF generation path:
Trace selected_evaluation in /generate_pdf/<pump_code> Route:
Action: Inside the app/routes.py -> generate_pdf_report function, immediately after selected_evaluation is determined (either from find_best_pumps or the fallback minimal_evaluation), add detailed logging:
logger.info(f"PDF Context - Pump Code: {pump_code}")
logger.info(f"PDF Context - Site Requirements used: {site_requirements}")
logger.info(f"PDF Context - Full 'selected_evaluation' object: {selected_evaluation}")
logger.info(f"PDF Context - 'selected_evaluation.operating_point': {selected_evaluation.get('operating_point')}")
# Also log target_pump if it's distinct from selected_evaluation['pump']
logger.info(f"PDF Context - 'target_pump' object (ParsedPumpData): {vars(target_pump) if target_pump else 'None'}")
Use code with caution.
Python
Goal: We need to see precisely what data is in selected_evaluation['operating_point'] just before it's passed to pdf_generator.generate_pdf or used to render the HTML for WeasyPrint.
Investigate why find_best_pumps Might Yield Different Results for PDF Route:
The /generate_pdf route re-runs find_best_pumps. Is it possible that the site_requirements object created within this route (site_requirements = SiteRequirements(flow_m3hr=flow, head_m=head)) is missing some context that the original /pump-options route had, leading to a different or failed evaluation?
Ensure load_all_pump_data() and parse_pump_data() behave identically when called from both routes.
Fix Chart Embedding for PDF (WeasyPrint):
Action: The generate_pump_charts function needs to save Matplotlib charts to disk. For WeasyPrint to embed them:
The HTML template (ape_report_template.html) passed to WeasyPrint must use absolute local file paths for the <img> tags' src attributes, or base64 encoded image data. url_for('static', ...) will not work directly for WeasyPrint unless your Flask app is running and serving those files while WeasyPrint makes HTTP requests (which is not typical for local PDF generation).
Recommendation for Agent: Modify generate_pump_charts to:
Save charts to a known path (e.g., app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER']).
Return the absolute file paths to these saved charts.
The ape_report_template.html should then use these absolute paths prefixed with file:///, e.g., src="file:///home/runner/workspace/app/static/temp/chart.png".
Alternatively, for greater portability, modify generate_pump_charts to return base64 encoded image strings and use data:image/png;base64,{{ base64_chart_string }} in the template.
Ensure Correct Impeller Diameter in PDF Text:
The PDF text for "6/8 ALE" (Page 4) says "configured with , has been selected..." (missing impeller).
Action: The ape_report_template.html needs to correctly access the impeller diameter for the selected curve from the selected_evaluation data (e.g., from selected_evaluation.operating_point.impeller_size or selected_evaluation.selected_curve.impeller_size).
Priority Order for Agent:
Resolve why the PDF context for '6/8 ALE' (and others) is getting 0.0 for key operating point metrics (Item #1 and #2). This is the most critical issue causing misleading report content.
Fix the chart image embedding for WeasyPrint (Item #3).
Fix the missing impeller diameter in the PDF text (Item #4).
Please add the detailed logging and investigate the data in selected_evaluation within the /generate_pdf route first."
