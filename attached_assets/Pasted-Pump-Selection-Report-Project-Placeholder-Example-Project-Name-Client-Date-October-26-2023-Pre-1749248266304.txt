Required Flow (Q_req): 1650 m³/hr
Required Head (H_req): 24.5 m
Fluid: Water
3. Performance Analysis & Alignment with Requirements:
The Mather+Platt / APE Pumps Model 28 HC 6P, configured with a 501mm impeller diameter and operating at 980 RPM, has been selected as highly suitable for the specified duty point.
Meeting the Duty Point:
At a flow rate of 1650 m³/hr, this pump configuration will deliver a head of approximately 24.5 m. This directly meets the specified head and flow requirements.
Reasoning: The operating point (1650 m³/hr, 24.5 m) falls directly on the performance curve for the 501mm impeller.


Operational Efficiency:
The pump will operate at an efficiency of approximately 84.8% at this duty point.
Reasoning & Insight: This operating point coincides almost precisely with the pump's Best Efficiency Point (BEP), which is marked at 84.8% on the performance curve. Operating at or very near the BEP is highly desirable as it:
Maximizes energy efficiency, leading to lower operational costs over the pump's lifespan.
Minimizes stress on pump components (bearings, seals), contributing to longer service life and reduced maintenance requirements.
Ensures smooth and stable hydraulic operation.

Power Consumption:
The anticipated absorbed power at the duty point is approximately 130 kW.
Reasoning & Insight: This is derived from the power curve for the 501mm impeller at a flow of 1650 m³/hr. Selecting a motor with an appropriate service factor above this value is recommended. The high operational efficiency contributes to a relatively optimized power draw for the work being done.


Net Positive Suction Head Required (NPSHr):
The NPSHr for the pump at 1650 m³/hr is approximately 6.8 meters.
Reasoning & Insight: This value is taken from the NPSH curve. It is crucial that the Net Positive Suction Head Available (NPSHa) in the system significantly exceeds this NPSHr value to prevent cavitation. Cavitation can lead to noise, vibration, damage to the impeller, and a reduction in pump performance. Ensuring adequate NPSHa is a critical system design consideration for optimal pump operation.


Pump Type Alignment:
The Vertical Turbine (VTP) design is well-suited for "Water Supply" applications, particularly for installations such as deep wells, sumps, or where space is a constraint for horizontal pumps.
Reasoning & Insight: Vertical turbine pumps are designed to handle significant volumes of water and can be staged (though this model is shown as single-stage, it can be up to 9 stages as per "Technical Details") to achieve higher heads if needed for different applications within the same pump range. The "Mixed Flow" impeller type provides a good balance between flow rate and head generation.


4. Key Insights & Recommendations:
Optimal Selection for Efficiency: The selection of the 28 HC 6P with a 501mm impeller for the duty of 1650 m³/hr at 24.5m head represents an optimal choice from an energy efficiency perspective, as it operates directly at its BEP.
System NPSH Verification: Critical attention must be paid to the system's NPSHa to ensure it is greater than the pump's 6.8m NPSHr to guarantee cavitation-free operation.
Motor Sizing: A motor should be selected based on the 130 kW power consumption, incorporating an appropriate service factor as per standard engineering practice.
Robust Design for Application: The pump's specifications (Vertical Turbine, Mixed Flow impeller) align well with standard requirements for robust water supply applications.
