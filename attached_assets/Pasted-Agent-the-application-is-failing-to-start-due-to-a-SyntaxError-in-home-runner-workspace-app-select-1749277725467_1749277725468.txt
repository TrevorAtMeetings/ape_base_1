Agent, the application is failing to start due to a SyntaxError in /home/runner/workspace/app/selection_engine.py.
Issue: SyntaxError: unterminated triple-quoted string literal (detected at line 761)
Action Required:
Open the file: /home/runner/workspace/app/selection_engine.py.
Locate the triple-quoted string: Look at line 756 (or the lines immediately preceding it) for the start of a multi-line string using """ or '''.
Find the Missing End: Carefully examine the code from line 756 down to line 761 (and potentially a bit further) to find where the closing triple quotes (""" or ''') are missing or if there's a syntax issue within the string itself that's confusing the parser (though "unterminated" usually means the closer is just gone).
It could be a large docstring for a function or class.
It could be a multi-line comment that was intended but not properly closed.
It's possible a closing """ was accidentally deleted or has a typo.
Correct the Syntax: Add the missing closing triple quotes or fix any syntax errors within the string.
Test: After making the correction, try running the application again (python app.py or using the Replit "Run" button) to see if it starts without this SyntaxError.
Example of what to look for:
# app/selection_engine.py

# ... other code ...

def some_function_or_class_around_line_756():
    """This is a long docstring that explains
    many things about this function. It might span
    several lines.

    Perhaps the developer was writing more here and accidentally
    deleted the closing part.
    # <--- MISSING """ HERE (if this is where it should end)

# ... code continues around line 761 ...
Use code with caution.
Python
Or:
# app/selection_engine.py
my_multiline_sql_query = """
SELECT column1, column2
FROM my_table
WHERE condition = 'some value
AND another_condition = 'oops, I forgot to close this quote and the triple quote' 
# <--- This internal quote and the missing """ are issues
"""
Use code with caution.
Python
The agent needs to carefully inspect that section of app/selection_engine.py and ensure all triple-quoted strings are properly formed and closed."
This is a straightforward syntax error, and the agent should be able to identify and fix it by ensuring all """...""" or '''...''' blocks are correctly terminated.
