Hello Agent,
Our next major task is to build out the functionality for the "Manufacturer Comparison" feature, which is a key component of our Brain System Administration dashboard.
The goal is to create a powerful workbench that allows our engineers to validate and calibrate the Brain's performance predictions against "ground truth" data from official manufacturer datasheets. This will be the primary tool for ensuring and continuously improving the accuracy of our selection engine.
We will start by building the core of this feature: the "Pump Calibration Workbench."
Implementation Plan:
Please create a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan for my review. Your plan should describe how you will build the following components:
1. The Backend Foundation:
New Routes: Propose the new backend routes required. We will need a route to display the workbench for a specific pump (e.g., /admin/pump-calibration/<pump_code>) and another to handle the analysis when the user submits data.
Comparison Logic: Describe the logic the backend will use to:
Accept a list of "ground truth" performance points (Flow, Head, Efficiency, Power) from the user.
Call the Brain's PerformanceAnalyzer to get its own predictions for the same flow points.
Calculate the percentage deltas between the ground truth and the Brain's predictions for each parameter.
2. The User Interface ("Pump Calibration Workbench"):
New Template: Describe the layout and key components of the new app/templates/admin/pump_calibration.html template. It must include:
A section to display the details of the pump being calibrated.
A dynamic form that allows an engineer to input multiple rows of performance data (Flow, Head, Efficiency, Power). The user should be able to add or remove rows as needed.
3. The "Delta Report" Display:
This will be the results section on the same workbench page, displayed after the user submits their data for analysis. Your plan should describe how you will present the results, including:
A Comparison Table: A detailed, side-by-side table comparing the "Ground Truth" values to the "Brain Prediction" values for each performance point, with color-coded "Delta %" columns.
A Visual Chart: A Plotly.js chart that overlays two curves on the same graph: one for the manufacturer's data and one for the Brain's predicted data. This will provide an instant visual comparison of the curve shapes.
AI-Powered Insights: A plan to integrate an AI call that analyzes the delta table and provides a human-readable summary of the findings (e.g., "The Brain's model is consistently over-predicting head by ~3% at low-flow conditions.").
Please provide your comprehensive plan for building this essential feature.
