Agent, this PDF report for the '6/8 ALE' pump is a massive step forward!
The Performance Characteristic Curves on Page 6 and 11 are now displaying correctly with actual pump data and the operating point marked! This is excellent!
The 'Selected Pump Specifications' table (Page 5) and the 'Operating Point Analysis' (Page 7) now show the correct, dynamically calculated values for Flow, Head, Efficiency, Power, Impeller Diameter, and NPSHr for the 6/8 ALE.
The 'Key Insights & Recommendations' (Page 10) also uses the correct performance data.
We need to address the remaining data discrepancies in the PDF's textual content and alternative options:
Fix "0.0" Values in Narrative Text on Page 4 ("Performance Analysis & Alignment with Requirements"):
Objective: Ensure the sentences describing "Meeting the Duty Point," "Operational Efficiency," "Power Consumption," and "Net Positive Suction Head Required" use the correct, calculated values (e.g., ~27.4m head, ~82.0% eff, ~112.1kW power, ~2.8m NPSHr), not 0.0.
Action:
Investigate ape_report_template.html (and any included sub-templates). Identify the Jinja2 variables used to generate these specific narrative sentences.
In app/routes.py (the /generate_pdf route or the pdf_generator.py module it calls), ensure the report_context being passed to this template correctly populates these specific narrative variables with the values from selected_evaluation.operating_point. They seem to be defaulting or using uninitialized variables.
Crucially, ensure the "Reasoning & Insight" bullet points (which are showing correct data) and the narrative sentences above them are drawing from the same, correct data source within the template context.
Fix Missing Impeller Diameter in Text on Page 4:
Objective: Display the selected impeller diameter in the sentence "The 6/8 ALE, configured with [IMPELLER DIAMETER], has been selected..."
Action: Ensure the template variable for impeller diameter (e.g., selected_evaluation.operating_point.impeller_size or selected_evaluation.pump.selected_impeller_diameter_from_curve) is correctly inserted here.
Fix "Overall Suitability Score" on Page 8:
Objective: Display the correct calculated overall score (e.g., 92.8% or 92.8/100).
Action: Ensure the template variable used here correctly accesses selected_evaluation.overall_score.
Fix Data for "Alternative Pump Options" on Page 9:
Objective: Display correct names and performance metrics for the alternative pumps.
Action:
In app/routes.py (PDF generation path), ensure the alternatives list (e.g., pump_selections[1:3]) contains evaluation objects with fully calculated and correct operating points and pump details.
Ensure ape_report_template.html correctly iterates through this alternatives list and accesses their data (e.g., alt_pump.pump_code, alt_pump.operating_point.achieved_efficiency_pct, etc.).
After these textual and alternative data fixes, the PDF report should be very close to complete for a single pump selection.
Please investigate the data flow to these specific template sections and make the necessary corrections. We are very pleased with the progress on the charts!"
