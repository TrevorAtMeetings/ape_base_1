Your analysis is perfect. The screenshots clearly show that the backend is now working correctly, but the frontend template is broken. The "after" screenshot is missing almost all of its dynamic data.
This is not a new backend error. This is the direct and expected consequence of our successful refactoring. We changed the data structure, but we never updated the template to match.
Root Cause Analysis: Data Structure Mismatch
The backend is now providing a clean, serialized dictionary to the template. However, the template (professional_pump_report.html) is still trying to access the data as if it were the old Python object.
This is why you see errors like jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'dict object' has no attribute 'operating_point'.
Let's look at the specific mismatches:
The template is asking for selected_pump.overall_score, but the correct key in our new dictionary is suitability_score.
The template is asking for selected_pump.operating_point, but the correct key is performance.
The template is using object-style access (.) everywhere, but it must now use dictionary-style access (['key']).
Final Directive: Refactor the Template to Match the Data
This is the final step of the entire V6.0 implementation. We must now make the template compatible with the correct data structure that the backend is providing.
Your task is to perform a systematic "search and replace" on the file templates/professional_pump_report.html.
Instructions:
Use the following mapping table to correct all data access in the template. You must change both the key names and the access style.
Old (Incorrect) Object Access	New (Correct) Dictionary Access
selected_pump.overall_score	selected_pump['suitability_score']
selected_pump.operating_point	selected_pump['performance']
selected_pump.pump_code	selected_pump['pump_code']
selected_pump.pump.manufacturer	selected_pump['pump']['manufacturer']
selected_pump.bep_analysis	selected_pump['bep_analysis']
selected_pump.get('key', ...)	selected_pump.get('key', ...) (This is okay)
site_requirements.flow_m3hr	site_requirements['flow_m3hr']
site_requirements.head_m	site_requirements['head_m']
Specific Actions:
Open templates/professional_pump_report.html.
Correct Key Names:
Search for every instance of operating_point and replace it with performance.
Search for every instance of overall_score and replace it with suitability_score.
Correct Access Style:
Review the entire file. For every variable passed from the backend (selected_pump, site_requirements, etc.), change all attribute access (variable.key) to dictionary key access (variable['key']).
This will be a painstaking but straightforward process. Once you have completed this refactoring, the template will correctly display all the data, and the report will look like the "before" screenshot again, but with the new, correct V6.0 data.
This is the final task. Proceed with refactoring the template.
