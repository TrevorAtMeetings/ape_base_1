Impeller trimming is a common method used to *adjust a pump's characteristics* to match various operating requirements, primarily by reducing the impeller's outer diameter [1-3]. This process is undertaken for economic reasons, allowing a given pump size to cover a specific performance range without unnecessary energy waste from throttling [2-4].

Here's a breakdown of how it's done, both practically and theoretically on a pump curve:

### Practical Application of Impeller Trimming

*   *Method:* Impeller trimming involves *reducing the outer diameter of the impeller* [2, 3].
    *   For *volute casing pumps*, both the impeller blades and the shrouds are typically trimmed to the same diameter [3, 5]. This helps reduce disk friction losses [5].
    *   For *diffuser pumps*, usually only the impeller blades are trimmed, while the shrouds are left at their full diameters [3, 6]. This is done to prevent instabilities in the characteristic and axial thrust excursions at partload, and to minimize the exchange of momentum between the main flow and the liquid rotating in the impeller sidewall gaps [6].
    *   *Oblique trimming* (Fig. 4.23c, d) is sometimes used for diffuser or double-entry pumps and is recommended for specific speeds above nq > 40 [5, 7]. This method can increase shut-off pressure and help guard against a characteristic that droops towards Q = 0 [5].
*   *Reasons for Trimming:*
    *   To *reduce head and power* at a constant flow rate [8].
    *   To *match the pump to the plant's required head* without throttling, which would waste energy [2, 9].
    *   To *optimize efficiency* when the pump is oversized for its application [10, 11].
    *   As a means to *shift the best efficiency point (BEP)*, although the shift is smaller than with a geometrically similar reduction of both impeller and collector [12].
    *   In practice, impellers are often *trimmed in steps* to reduce the risk of over-trimming and missing the desired operating point [13].
*   *Physical Effects of Trimming:*
    *   The impeller's outer diameter is reduced, but the *impeller outlet width remains identical or increases slightly* [2].
    *   The *blade outlet angle may change*, and the blades become shorter [2].
    *   Blade shortening leads to *higher blade loading* and *lower flow deflection*, resulting in a drop in the slip factor [12-15].
    *   The discharge angle in the absolute reference frame increases [12].
    *   The distance between impeller blades and diffuser vanes (or cutwaters) increases, which can reduce noise and vibrations initially, but major trimming can increase hydraulic excitation forces due to higher blade loading [16].

### Theoretical Representation on a Pump Curve

Impeller trimming significantly alters the pump's performance curve, often in ways that deviate from the simple Affinity Laws.

1.  *Head, Flow, and Power Alteration:*
    *   The characteristics of a pump with a trimmed impeller *cannot be calculated precisely using the similarity laws* because a trimmed impeller is not geometrically similar to the full-diameter impeller [2].
    *   Empirical relationships are often used for calculation. One common set of formulas (Eq. 4.15) uses an exponent ⁠ m ⁠ to relate changes in flow (Q') and head (H') to the ratio of the trimmed diameter (D') to the full diameter (D) [17, 18]:
        *   ⁠ Q' = Q * (D'/D)^m ⁠
        *   ⁠ H' = H * (D'/D)^m ⁠
        *   The exponent ⁠ m ⁠ typically lies *between 2 and 3* [18, 19]. For trims smaller than the profile length, ⁠ m ⁠ is closer to 3, while for trims exceeding 5% of the impeller diameter, ⁠ m ⁠ is near 2 [19]. Theoretically, if blade outlet angle and width do not change with radius, ⁠ m=2 ⁠ applies [19].
    *   The *head drops* roughly proportionally to the reduction of ⁠ D ⁠ [12, 20].
    *   The *power output decreases* approximately as ⁠ D^3 ⁠ [21].
    *   The magnitude of deviation from the similarity law depends on impeller geometry and blade pressure distribution [17]. Shorter blade lengths (i.e., higher specific speeds) lead to a greater head reduction for a given trim ratio [17].
    *   Some sources state that the impeller's *head should be proportional to ⁠ (D'/D)^2 ⁠* assuming constant efficiency and similar exit velocity triangles [20]. However, the assumptions for these "affinity laws" are rarely fulfilled in practice, so exact predictions should not be expected [22].
    *   In radial discharge impellers, the meridional exit area decreases with cutting, causing *head to fall more than predicted* by the ⁠ (D'/D)^2 ⁠ relationship [22].

2.  *Best Efficiency Point (BEP) Shift:*
    *   The BEP is *shifted towards smaller flow rates* (lower Q) than with the full-diameter impeller [12, 23].
    *   This is because the volute characteristic remains unchanged, while the head is reduced [12].
    *   The BEP of all trim curves lies on a line (e.g., #4 in Fig. 4.20) that intersects the abscissa at a value of ⁠ q*a ≈ (0.005 to 0.01) nq ⁠ [19]. Some suggest that BEPs for trimmed impellers should be assumed on a straight line through the origin [24].
    *   The *specific speed at BEP increases* as the impeller diameter is reduced [21].

3.  *Efficiency Changes:*
    *   The *efficiency at BEP approximately drops* with trimming, quantified by ⁠ Δη = ε(1-d2'/d2) ⁠, where ⁠ ε ⁠ is a factor (0.15 to 0.25 for volute pumps, 0.4 to 0.5 for diffuser pumps) [7, 25].
    *   In some cases, for small specific speeds, a *slight trimming can even increase efficiency* because impeller disk friction losses decrease with the 5th power of the diameter [25].
    *   The power consumption of the trimmed impeller increases compared to an untrimmed one, due to the efficiency drop [26]. This can lead to increased energy costs [27].

4.  *NPSH and Cavitation Impact:*
    *   Severe trimming (more than 10%) can *deteriorate suction characteristics, leading to an **increase in NPSH3* [7, 13].
    *   Reasons for increased NPSH3 include altered pressure distribution due to blade shortening and increased blade loading [13, 28].
    *   A 3% head drop for a severely trimmed impeller represents a smaller absolute change in head than for a full-diameter impeller, which can lead to a higher measured NPSH3 value after trimming [13, 28].
    *   The NPSHR may appear to increase with trimming beyond certain specific speeds (e.g., 2000 USgpm units) [29].
    *   When a pump is slowed down, the NPSHR increases slightly relative to affinity law predictions; this is related to changes in the internal pressure rise gradient and bubble residence time [30].

5.  *Operational Behavior and Limitations:*
    *   Excessive blade shortening due to trimming can *deteriorate operational behavior, potentially causing **vibrations and noise* [14]. This is particularly true for high-power pumps [14].
    *   Trimming does not change the flow rate of shockless impeller entry. Therefore, a heavily trimmed impeller might operate with continuous inlet recirculation, leading to noise, vibrations, and cavitation damage [10, 14].
    *   *Limits for diameter reduction* are recommended to avoid excessive blade shortening and operational problems [31]:
        *   For nq < 40: ⁠ d2'/d2 ≥ 0.8 to 0.85 ⁠
        *   For 40 < nq < 100: ⁠ d2'/d2 ≥ 0.8 to 0.85 + 0.0025 * (nq - 40) ⁠ [31].
    *   These limits are for medium-sized pumps; smaller pumps (where noise/vibration are less critical) might be trimmed further [32].
    *   For *diffuser pumps*, trimming should not exceed 5% without experimental determination of the limit, as excessive trimming can cause instability [33].
    *   *Noise and vibrations typically diminish with slight trimming* because the distance between impeller blades and the collector increases. However, major trimming can increase hydraulic excitation forces due to increased blade loading [16].
    *   In *turbine operation*, impeller trimming has little effect on the characteristic near BEP, as the theoretical specific work remains virtually unchanged [34]. However, runaway head drops and partload efficiency improves [35].
    *   Trimming the rear shroud of a radial pump to 70% of the impeller diameter improved two-phase performance by inducing recirculation at the impeller outlet, breaking up gas accumulations [36].

In summary, while impeller trimming is a valuable tool for adapting pumps to specific system requirements and achieving cost savings, its application must be carefully considered, especially for larger pumps and higher specific speeds, due to potential negative impacts on efficiency, cavitation, and operational stability.
