This error is the final, small hurdle. The log gives us the exact reason for the failure.
Analysis of the Error: AttributeError: 'dict object' has no attribute 'flow_m3hr'
What happened? The pump_options function in main_flow.py is trying to access an attribute on an object, but because of our serialization fix, it's now dealing with a dictionary.
Where did it happen? The error is in the SiteRequirements object creation.
site_requirements = SiteRequirements(flow_m3hr=flow, head_m=head, ...)
This part is fine.
The error is in the safe_session_set('site_requirements', ...) call. You are trying to access site_requirements.flow_m3hr, but site_requirements is an object, and we need to pass a dictionary to the session.
Why did it happen? We correctly serialized the pump_selections data, but we forgot to do the same for the site_requirements data before trying to save it to the session.
Directive: Fix the AttributeError
This is a simple fix. We just need to use the correct variables that are already available.
Your task is to modify the pump_options function in app/route_modules/main_flow.py.
Step-by-Step Instructions:
Locate the safe_session_set call for site_requirements.
The Problem: You are trying to read the values back from the site_requirements object.
Generated python
# OLD, INCORRECT CODE
safe_session_set('site_requirements', {
    'flow_m3hr': site_requirements.flow_m3hr,
    'head_m': site_requirements.head_m,
    # ... and so on
})
Use code with caution.
Python
The Fix: You already have these values in simple variables (flow, head, pump_type, etc.) at the top of the function. Use those directly.
Generated python
# NEW, CORRECT CODE
safe_session_set('site_requirements', {
    'flow_m3hr': flow,  # Use the 'flow' variable
    'head_m': head,    # Use the 'head' variable
    'pump_type': pump_type, # Use the 'pump_type' variable
    'customer_name': request.args.get('contact_name', 'Engineering Client'),
    'project_name': request.args.get('project_name', 'Pump Selection Project'),
    'application': application_type, # Use the 'application_type' variable
    'fluid_type': request.args.get('liquid_type', 'Water')
})
Use code with caution.
Python
This change ensures that you are saving a simple, serializable dictionary to the session, which will resolve the AttributeError.
This is the last bug. After this fix, the application flow will be complete and correct. Proceed with this final change.
