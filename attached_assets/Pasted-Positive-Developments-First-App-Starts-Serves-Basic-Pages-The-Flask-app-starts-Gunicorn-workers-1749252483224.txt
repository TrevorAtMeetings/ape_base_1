Positive Developments First:
App Starts & Serves Basic Pages: The Flask app starts, Gunicorn workers boot, the LLM module initializes, and the index route (/) is served correctly. Static files are also being served (304 Not Modified, which is fine).
Data Loading (3 Pumps): Still loading the 3 pumps.
LLM API Calls Succeeding: INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK". This means the network communication with OpenAI is working.
Selection Engine Finding Some Pumps: INFO:app.selection_engine:Found 2 suitable pumps, returning top 2.
Key Issues & Errors Revealed:
Extrapolation/Interpolation Failures & NoneType Errors (Recurring):
WARNING:app.performance_calculator:Target value 342.0 far outside curve range [0.0, 191.7] with tolerance
WARNING:app.performance_calculator:Interpolation failed for pump 5 K at flow 342.0 - failed: ['head', 'efficiency', 'power', 'npshr']
WARNING:app.performance_calculator:No suitable curve found for 5 K
ERROR:app.selection_engine:Error generating reasoning: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'
Analysis: This is the same underlying problem as before. The input flow (342.0 mÂ³/hr) is too far outside the defined curve ranges for some pumps, even with the 20% extrapolation tolerance. When interpolation fails, calculate_operating_point likely returns an object/dictionary where key performance metrics are None. The selection_engine then tries to use these None values (e.g., when preparing data for LLM reasoning or other analyses), leading to the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'.
Instruction to Agent (Reiterate & Strengthen): "Agent, we are still seeing 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get' errors in app.selection_engine when generating reasoning. This is because pumps for which interpolation fails (due to flow being too far out of range) are still having their (now invalid/None) operating points passed to reasoning generation or other analysis functions.
In app.selection_engine.find_best_pumps or app.selection_engine.evaluate_pump_for_requirements: If calculate_operating_point returns an indication of failure (e.g., an error flag in the dictionary, or essential metrics like achieved_head_m are None), that pump/curve combination must be considered unsuitable. Do not proceed to generate LLM reasoning or perform detailed BEP/NPSH/Power analysis for such invalid operating points. Either assign a very low score or filter them out before attempting these advanced analyses.
The selection_engine should only attempt detailed analysis and LLM reasoning for pumps that have a valid, calculated operating point (even if extrapolated, as long as the extrapolation was deemed acceptable)."
NEW CRITICAL ERROR: werkzeug.routing.exceptions.BuildError (URL Building Failed)
ERROR:app.routes:Error in pump_options: Could not build url for endpoint 'professional_pump_report' with values ['flow', 'head', 'pump_code']. Did you mean 'pump_report' instead?
This error occurs when the code (likely in a template, or in app/routes.py if doing a redirect with url_for) tries to generate a URL using url_for('professional_pump_report', ...).
Analysis:
Flask cannot find a route endpoint named 'professional_pump_report'.
The error message helpfully suggests: "Did you mean 'pump_report' instead?". This implies you likely have a route defined with the function name pump_report (e.g., @app.route('/pump-report/<pump_code>') def pump_report(pump_code): ...) or you named its endpoint 'pump_report'.
The error also states it was trying to build the URL with values for ['flow', 'head', 'pump_code']. The endpoint it thinks you mean ('pump_report') must be able to accept these parameters, or the url_for call needs to be adjusted.
Where is url_for('professional_pump_report', ...) being called? It's happening after the "Found 2 suitable pumps" and after the LLM calls, but before the Index route accessed for the redirect. This means it's likely happening at the end of the /pump-options (or /results) route, possibly when preparing data for the template or if there's an internal redirect. The request URL shown GET /pump-options?flow=342&head=27.4... indicates a route named pump_options is being processed.
Instruction to Agent:
"Agent, there's a BuildError because the code is trying to use url_for('professional_pump_report', ...).
Step 1: Find the Call: Locate where url_for('professional_pump_report', ...) is being called. It's likely in the app/routes.py file, within the route handler for /pump-options (or /results if pump_options is an alias or internal name for the results processing logic).
Step 2: Identify Correct Endpoint Name: Check your route definitions. What is the actual function name or endpoint name for generating the detailed pump report (likely the PDF)? The error suggests it might be 'pump_report'.
Step 3: Correct the url_for Call: Change url_for('professional_pump_report', ...) to url_for('pump_report', ...) (or whatever the correct endpoint name is).
Step 4: Verify Parameters: Ensure the target route (pump_report or similar) is defined to accept pump_code, flow, and head as parameters if they are truly needed to generate the URL for that report. For example:
# In app/routes.py
@app.route('/pump-report/<pump_code>/<float:flow>/<float:head>') # Example
def pump_report(pump_code, flow, head):
    # ... logic to generate report ...
    pass
Use code with caution.
Python
Or, if these are query parameters:
@app.route('/pump-report/<pump_code>')
def pump_report(pump_code):
    flow = request.args.get('flow')
    head = request.args.get('head')
    # ...
    pass
Use code with caution.
Python
The url_for call should match how the target route expects its arguments."
Redirect after Error:
INFO:werkzeug: ... "GET /pump-options?... HTTP/1.1" 302 -
A 302 redirect happens immediately after the BuildError. This means your try...except block in the /pump-options (or /results) route is catching the BuildError and then likely doing a return redirect(url_for('index')). This is good error handling behavior, but the underlying BuildError needs fixing.
Summary of Immediate Actions for the Agent:
Fix url_for BuildError (High Priority):
Locate the call to url_for('professional_pump_report', ...).
Change 'professional_pump_report' to the correct endpoint name (likely 'pump_report').
Ensure the parameters passed to url_for match what the target route expects.
Strengthen NoneType Error Handling in selection_engine (High Priority):
Ensure that if calculate_operating_point indicates a failure for a pump/curve, no further detailed analysis (BEP, NPSH, Power) or LLM reasoning generation is attempted for that invalid point. This will stop the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get' errors.
Improve performance_calculator for Out-of-Range Flows (High Priority):
Implement the 20% extrapolation logic robustly.
If flow is still too far out even for extrapolation, calculate_operating_point must return a clear error status/object that the selection_engine can check.
Log when extrapolation is used.
Review Chart Generation (generate_pump_charts):
Once the selection engine is more robust, ensure this function uses actual curve data from the selected pump, not dummy data, for plotting all four charts (Head, Efficiency, Power, NPSH).
The Gunicorn timeout seems to be avoided with these specific inputs (Flow=342, Head=27.4) because perhaps fewer "suitable" pumps are found, leading to fewer LLM calls. However, the underlying issue of too many synchronous LLM calls will resurface if a query results in many valid pumps for detailed reasoning. The temporary fix of limiting LLM calls or increasing Gunicorn timeout should still be considered after these more immediate bugs are squashed.
