Agent, for the UI: e.g., "All charts are now correctly embedded and displaying real data!", "NPSH chart is handled gracefully for pumps/UX enhancements, let's focus on the following for the web pages (pump_options.html which shows without data.", "Alternative pump data is accurate.", "Overall suitability score is correct.", "Prepared for/Pump Range fields are populated." summary cards, and professional_pump_report.html which is the detailed web view):
Our Goal: Create a clean, professional, intuitive, and highly informative web experience, drawing inspiration from Google Material Design and the APE Pumps branding].
[Note any tiny remaining PDF issues, if any, for a final polish later].
**The PDF generation.
Key UI/UX Enhancement Tasks (Prioritized):
Interactive Plotly.js Charts as functionality is now considered complete and robust for this phase! This is a major milestone. Please update the master_plan.md and Primary Web Display:
Objective: Replace static Matplotlib images on the web view of the detailed report (professionaldocs/build_insights.md` to reflect this achievement.**
Now, as you suggested, let's proceed with_pump_report.html`) with the fully interactive Plotly.js charts as per the "Pump Performance Charting Component Specification" we UI/UX Enhancements for the web pages, specifically:
pump_options.html (or equivalent results summary page)
**professional_pump_report.html (the web view discussed.
Recall Key Features:
All four charts (Head, Efficiency, Power, NPS of the detailed report)**
Our goals for these UI/UX enhancements are:
**Interactive Plotly.js Charts asH).
* Operating point clearly marked on each chart.
* Visual indicators for extrapolated vs Primary Web Display:
Replace/supplement static Matplotlib images on the detailed web report page (professional_pump_report.html) with. within-range operating points (e.g., Green Star vs. Orange Triangle).** This uses the `*_ the fully interactive Plotly.js charts as per the "Pump Performance Charting Component Specification."
Ensurewas_extrapolated` flags from the backend.
Hover-over tooltips for data points.
Zoom/ the operating point is marked with green stars (within original curve range) or orange triangles (extrapolated value), leveragingpan capabilities.
Responsive design.
Clean, professional dark theme (or APE-aligned theme the *_was_extrapolated flags.
Ensure graceful handling if chart data is unavailable (e.g.,).
Action: Integrate your static/js/charts.js (and any helper JS for NPSH).
Clear UI Indication of Extrapolated Values (Beyond Charts):
On like chart_layout_fix.js, chart_legend_fix.js) fully. Ensure the /api/chart_data_safe both the summary card page (pump_options.html) and the detailed web report (professional_pump_report.html), ensure/... endpoint provides all necessary data in the correct format for these charts.
UI Indication for Extrapolated Values that any textual or tabular display of a key performance metric (Head, Efficiency, Power) that was derived from extrapolation has a clear visual cue (e.g., an asterisk * next to the value, a different text color, or a small icon (Text & Tables):
Objective: Clearly inform the user on all web pages if displayed numerical data was derived from extrapolation.
Action: On both the summary card page (`pump_options. with a tooltip: "Value is extrapolated and may be less accurate").
UX Refinement for "Technicalhtml) and the detailed web report (professional_pump_report.html`), for any key operating point metric (Head, Efficiency, Power) Analysis" Sections (BEP, NPSH on web report):
Review the display of BEP analysis and NPSH analysis on displayed in text or tables that was extrapolated, add a clear visual cue (e.g., an asterisk * next to the value the detailed web report page. Ensure the data structures provided by pump_engine.py are presented clearly and align). Include a general note/legend on the page explaining the meaning of the asterisk (e.g., "* Value derived from extrapolation, accuracy may vary"). This uses the *_was_extrapolated flags.
**Refine " with template expectations (addressing your audit Issue #9: Template BEP Analysis Structure Mismatch).
Technical Analysis" Section Display (Web Detailed Report):**
Objective: Make the BEP Analysis,Chart Race Condition Prevention (Agent Audit Issue #8):
Implement the single chart manager instance or initialization state NPSH Analysis, etc., sections on professional_pump_report.html more structured and user-friendly.
tracking in static/js/charts.js to prevent multiple initializations and potential race conditions if the Plotly.js charts are loaded dynamically or Agent's Audit Finding #9: "Backend provides flat calculations, templates expect structured objects" for BEP analysis.
Action:
Review the data structure provided by pump_engine.py for `b if the user navigates in a way that might re-trigger initialization.
Please start with Objective 1: Implementingep_analysis,npsh_analysis,power_analysis. * Updateprofessional_pump_report.htmlthe Interactive Plotly.js Charts on the detailed web report page (professional_pump_report.html`).
Ensure the /api/chart_data_safe/... endpoint is robustly providing all necessary data (curves, operating to best display this information. Consider using small definition lists, clearly labeled metrics, or mini-cards for each analysis subsection point with extrapolation flags).
Leverage the JavaScript functions from the 'Pump Performance Charting Component Specification' you.
* If the LLM-generated bep_explanation, npsh_explanation, power_explanation are available and robust, integrate them here.
**Progressive Reveal for Input Form (input_form.html) were given earlier.
Report back once the interactive charts are integrated and functioning with the operating point markers and extrapolation visuals." - Revisit:**
* Objective: Improve the user experience for data input.
* **Agent
This sequence ensures you validate the critical PDF output before moving on to enhance the web UI with more advanced interactive features. The's Previous Fix:** Disabled complex JS to ensure stability.
* Action: Now that the app is more stable, implement agent's detailed plan is making this a very structured process!
