Let's go through each file (pump_engine.py, app/__init__.py, app/utils.py, app/routes.py, data/pumps_database.json, and main.py) with a fine-tooth comb.
Overall High-Level Observations:
Consolidation into pump_engine.py: This is a good strategic move to centralize core logic.
Data Normalization Attempt: The load_all_pump_data function in pump_engine.py now attempts to normalize field names from the objPump structure to a more standard Pythonic naming convention (e.g., pPumpCode to pump_code). This is good for consistency within the application.
Advanced Analysis Stubs: The imports for llm_reasoning, advanced_analyzer, pump_comparator, system_curve_analyzer in pump_engine.py indicate these are planned or partially implemented. The main find_best_pumps function calls some of these.
Extrapolation Logic: The interpolate_value function now has an explicit 20% extrapolation margin.
Fallback Mechanisms: There are attempts to provide fallback values or estimates if interpolations fail or data is missing.
Clearer app/routes.py: The routing logic is becoming more organized.
pumps_database.json Structure: The sample JSON provided is key to understanding the input data.
Detailed Review & Critical Findings:
1. pump_engine.py:
Data Structure Duplication (RESOLVED): The agent has correctly put SiteRequirements and ParsedPumpData class definitions here. This is good, assuming utils.py no longer defines them.
load_all_pump_data():
Path: os.path.join('data', 'pumps_database.json'). This assumes the script is run from the project root where data/ is a subdirectory. This is fine for Replit.
Normalization Logic:
normalized_pump = {
    'pump_code': obj_pump.get('pPumpCode', ''),
    'model': obj_pump.get('pModel', ''),
    # ... many other fields ...
    'curve_flow_m3hr': obj_pump.get('pM_FLOW', ''), # Key for curve parsing
    # ...
}
Use code with caution.
Python
This normalization is GOOD. It means the rest of pump_engine.py (like _parse_performance_curves) should expect these normalized keys (e.g., curve_flow_m3hr) when it receives a pump_json_obj from this loader.
ParsedPumpData.__init__():
self.pump_info = pump_info  # Store original pump_info for compatibility
self.model = pump_info.get('model', '') # EXPECTS NORMALIZED KEY
self.manufacturer = pump_info.get('manufacturer', '') # EXPECTS NORMALIZED KEY
# ...
self.bep_flow_std = pump_info.get('bep_flow_std', 0) # EXPECTS NORMALIZED KEY
Use code with caution.
Python
This class initializer is now correctly expecting the normalized keys that load_all_pump_data produces. The self.pump_info = pump_info line stores the already normalized dictionary. This is consistent.
interpolate_value():
Extrapolation margin is 20%.
fill_value=0 in scipy.interpolate.interp1d and then return float(result) if result != 0 else _linear_interpolate(...). This means if Scipy extrapolates to 0 (which can happen if the trend is towards zero and fill_value is not "extrapolate"), it will then try the manual linear interpolation. The manual _linear_interpolate returns a boundary value if outside the original range.
Issue: Still no explicit was_extrapolated flag returned. This information is lost.
Potential Bug: If scipy.interpolate.interp1d is not found (e.g., from scipy.interpolate import interp1d fails or is not present at the top of the file), the try...except block will always fall back to _linear_interpolate. Ensure scipy is a firm dependency.
calculate_operating_point():
Correctly checks if target flow is outside the 20% extended range and returns an error dict.
Fallbacks for None interpolation results using _linear_interpolate.
Final "Reasonable Estimates" Fallback:
if any(val is None or val <= 0 for val in [head, efficiency, power]):
    # ... assigns conservative estimates ...
Use code with caution.
Python
This is a double-edged sword. It prevents NoneType errors downstream but means the returned operating point might not reflect the pump's actual capabilities at all. This needs to be clearly flagged (e.g., add {'estimation_used': True} to the return) so that such results can be heavily penalized or treated with extreme caution in the selection_engine. The current extrapolated flag only checks against original curve min/max, not if these estimates were used.
The returned operating_point dictionary is comprehensive.
_parse_performance_curves() & _parse_single_curve():
These now correctly expect the normalized keys from obj_pump (e.g., obj_pump.get('curve_flow_m3hr', '')). This is consistent with load_all_pump_data.
Power calculation in _parse_single_curve is correct.
NPSH padding while len(npshrs) < len(flows): npshrs.append(npshrs[-1] if npshrs else 3.0) is still a guess. If the source pM_NP string doesn't provide enough points, this manufactures data. Better to have None or fewer points and let interpolation handle it (or fail).
find_best_pumps():
Good loop, try-except for evaluate_pump_for_requirements.
LLM calls (if they were still in this file, now moved to selection_engine.py in the previous snippets) for top choice only is good.
_generate_selection_reason is a good fallback.
evaluate_pump_for_requirements():
Initializes a default evaluation dict – good for ensuring consistent structure.
Calls find_best_curve_for_duty.
If operating_point is valid, it calls _analyze_bep_performance, _analyze_npsh_requirements, _analyze_power_consumption, and calculate_pump_suitability_score.
This seems to be the main orchestration function for evaluating a single pump.
find_best_curve_for_duty():
Calculates a combined_score = head_match_score * 0.7 + efficiency_score * 0.3.
This scoring is simple and might need refinement (e.g., heavily penalize if head_match_score is very low or negative).
calculate_pump_suitability_score():
Calculates head_accuracy and efficiency_score.
overall_score = head_accuracy * 0.6 + efficiency_score * 0.4.
The requirements parameter is optional and used for bonus/penalties (type matching, NPSH check). This is good.
Returns suitable: final_score > 30. This threshold is arbitrary and might need tuning.
Analysis Functions (_analyze_bep_performance, _analyze_npsh_requirements, _analyze_power_consumption):
These are the new detailed analysis functions. They look reasonable and try to provide fallback values if primary data is missing from operating_point.
_analyze_bep_performance: bep_flow = getattr(parsed_pump, 'bep_flow_std', flow * 1.1) – if bep_flow_std isn't available on parsed_pump (e.g., it was 0 or missing from JSON), it estimates BEP flow. This can lead to inaccuracies in "distance from BEP."
_analyze_npsh_requirements: Calculates NPSHa based on simplified assumptions (elevation, temperature). This is a good first step for providing context but should be highlighted as an estimation.
2. app/utils.py (New Version):
load_all_pump_data():
This version is simpler than the one in pump_engine.py. It just loads data.get('pumps', []) and does no normalization.
CRITICAL INCONSISTENCY: You now have two load_all_pump_data functions. One in pump_engine.py (which does normalization and handles the objPump wrapper) and one in app/utils.py (which does not). The app/routes.py imports from pump_engine, so it should be using the normalizing version. The utils.py version seems to be a leftover or an older version.
SiteRequirements and ParsedPumpData Classes: These are also defined here. They are very similar to the ones in pump_engine.py. This duplication MUST be resolved.
validate_site_requirements(): Similar to the one in pump_engine.py.
3. app/routes.py (New Version):
Imports:
from pump_engine import load_all_pump_data, parse_pump_data, find_best_pumps, validate_site_requirements, SiteRequirements, ParsedPumpData
Use code with caution.
Python
This correctly implies that pump_engine.py is now the single source of truth for these core functions and classes. This resolves the previous duplicate import confusion. This is a very good change.
show_results() Route:
Calls the imported functions from pump_engine.
valid_selections check:
if (selection.get('operating_point') and
    (selection['operating_point'].get('achieved_head_m') is not None or
     selection['operating_point'].get('head_m') is not None) and # Checks for 'head_m' too
    not selection['operating_point'].get('error')):
Use code with caution.
Python
This check is more robust for ensuring a valid operating point. Good.
The rest of the logic for preparing template_data and redirecting to pump_report seems okay, assuming find_best_pumps returns the data in the expected structure.
/pump-options Route:
Still uses dummy evaluation:
pump_evaluations = []
for i, pump in enumerate(parsed_pumps[:3]):
    # Calculate basic performance metrics (DUMMY VALUES)
    efficiency = 78 - (i * 3) 
    # ...
Use code with caution.
Python
CRITICAL: This route is using placeholder/dummy data for pump_evaluations instead of calling the actual find_best_pumps or evaluate_pump_for_requirements from pump_engine.py. This means the "Pump Selection Results" page shown in your last screenshot (which is likely rendered by pump_options.html if the form now GETs to /pump-options) is not using your real selection engine at all. This explains why the Power, NPSH, Impeller size, and Scores were nonsensical.
/pump_report/<path:pump_code> Route:
Relies on session data or regenerates selections if session is empty.
Still has the hardcoded '6/8 ALE' data. This should be removed once the engine is reliable.
Renders professional_pump_report.html.
/professional_pump_report/<path:pump_code> Alias:
def professional_pump_report(pump_code): return pump_report(pump_code)
This correctly creates an alias if some templates were still using url_for('professional_pump_report').
generate_pump_charts():
Still using x_dummy, y_dummy. Must be fixed to plot real data.
Correctly uses url_for('static', filename=f'temp/{head_chart_filename}').
4. data/pumps_database.json:
Format: It's a dictionary with a top-level "pumps" key, which contains a list of objects. Each object has an "objPump" key, which then contains the actual pump data with pField names.
This matches the structure that the normalizing load_all_pump_data in pump_engine.py is designed to handle.
5. main.py (Entry point):
from app import app
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, debug=True)
Perfect. This is clean and correct.
Summary of Critical Findings & Actions for Agent:
Resolve Duplicate Code & Single Source of Truth (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
Instruction: "Agent, there are duplicate definitions of SiteRequirements, ParsedPumpData, load_all_pump_data, and validate_site_requirements in pump_engine.py AND app/utils.py.
Consolidate these into pump_engine.py as it seems to be the central engine.
Remove app/utils.py completely or ensure it only contains truly generic utilities not specific to pump logic if any exist.
All imports throughout the app package (e.g., in app/routes.py) must now import these classes and functions solely from pump_engine (e.g., from pump_engine import SiteRequirements, load_all_pump_data)."
Fix Data Normalization vs. Parsing Mismatch (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
Instruction: "Agent, the load_all_pump_data function in pump_engine.py normalizes field names (e.g., pPumpCode -> pump_code, pM_FLOW -> curve_flow_m3hr).
The ParsedPumpData.__init__ in pump_engine.py now correctly uses these normalized names (e.g., pump_info.get('model', '')). This is good.
Crucially, the _parse_performance_curves function (and its helper _parse_single_curve) within pump_engine.py must ALSO be updated to expect these normalized keys from the obj_pump dictionary it receives (which is actually the normalized_pump dictionary from load_all_pump_data). For example, it should use obj_pump.get('curve_flow_m3hr', '') instead of looking for obj_pump.get('pM_FLOW', '') if pM_FLOW is no longer a key after normalization."
Fix /pump-options Route to Use Real Selection Logic:
Instruction: "Agent, the /pump-options route in app/routes.py is currently generating dummy placeholder data for pump_evaluations.
This route must call the actual find_best_pumps function from pump_engine.py (similar to how the /results POST route was intended to work before it was changed to redirect).
It should then pass these real pump_evaluations to the pump_options.html template. This is why the results page is showing incorrect Power, NPSH, etc."
Implement "Extrapolated" Flag in interpolate_value and calculate_operating_point:
Instruction (Reiterate): "Agent, in pump_engine.py:
interpolate_value must return a tuple/dict indicating the value AND was_extrapolated: True/False.
calculate_operating_point must include these was_extrapolated flags for each metric in its returned dictionary.
The extrapolated key currently in calculate_operating_point's return only checks if target_flow < curve_min or target_flow > curve_max (original range). This is fine for a general flag, but individual metric extrapolation flags would be more precise if scipy.interpolate.interp1d with fill_value="extrapolate" is used (though your current interpolate_value uses fill_value=0 then fallbacks). Let's ensure the general extrapolated flag is accurate based on whether the original curve boundaries were exceeded."
Static Chart Generation with Real Data (generate_pump_charts in app/routes.py):
Instruction (Reiterate): "Agent, generate_pump_charts must plot actual pump curve data from the parsed_pump_obj.curves (for the selected curve/impeller) and mark the calculated operating_point. Replace the dummy plotting data (x_dummy, y_dummy). Generate all four charts."
Robust None/Error Handling in Analysis Functions (Reiterate):
Instruction: "Agent, ensure all analysis functions in pump_engine.py (BEP, NPSH, Power, scoring, LLM prep) robustly handle cases where operating_point data might be incomplete or None due to earlier interpolation/extrapolation failures. They should return defaults or error indicators gracefully."
Review Scoring Logic for Out-of-Bounds Scores:
Instruction: "Agent, double-check the _calculate_enhanced_score and calculate_pump_suitability_score in pump_engine.py to ensure the final score is correctly capped between 0 and 100. The current template shows scores like 8500/100."
Focus Order for the Agent:
Code Consolidation & Normalization Fix (Items 1 & 2 above): This is foundational. If data isn't flowing consistently, nothing else will work.
Fix /pump-options to use Real Logic (Item 3): This will make the results page actually use your selection engine.
Fix Extrapolation & None Handling (Items 4 & 6): Essential for robustness.
Fix Static Chart Data (Item 5): Visuals need to be accurate.
Fix Scoring (Item 7): Scores need to be in the correct range.
