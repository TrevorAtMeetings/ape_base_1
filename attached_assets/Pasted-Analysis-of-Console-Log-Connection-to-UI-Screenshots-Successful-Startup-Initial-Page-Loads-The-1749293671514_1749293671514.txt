Detailed Report Page (/professional_pump_report/...) Access:
When "6/8 ALE" detailed report is accessed:
INFO:app.routes:Displaying report for pump: 6/8 ALE
INFO:app.routes:Template data - selected_pump operating_point: {'flow_m3hr': 342.0, 'achieved_head_m': 27.4, 'achieved_efficiency_pct': 82.0, 'achieved_power_kw': 31.14, 'achieved_npshr_m': 2.78}
INFO:app.routes:Template data - selected_pump selected_curve: {'impeller_size': '312', 'is_selected': True, 'curve_index': 2}
This data for "6/8 ALE" is the HARDCODED data from app/routes.py in the pump_report function. This explains why it looks perfect in the earlier screenshot of the detailed report page for 6/8 ALE.
When "6 K 6 VANE" detailed report is accessed:
INFO:app.routes:Displaying report for pump: 6 K 6 VANE
INFO:app.routes:Template data - selected_pump operating_point: {'achieved_efficiency_pct': 74.75, ... 'impeller_size': '394', ...} - This is the calculated operating point.
INFO:app.routes:Template data - selected_pump selected_curve: {} - CRITICAL: selected_curve is an empty dictionary! This is why "Selected Impeller Diameter" is N/Amm in the detailed report screenshot for "6 K 6 VANE", and why the report says "...configured with a N/Amm impeller..."
The report also says "At a flow rate of 0.0 m³/hr..." - This is still a major issue in the detailed report's textual content generation. It seems the report_context or selected_pump data being used to generate the text of the detailed report is somehow getting a 0.0 flow, even if the operating_point dictionary itself has the correct 342.0 flow.
Chart API for "6 K 6 VANE" - Further Issues:
WARNING:app.performance_calculator:Insufficient curve points for interpolation
WARNING:app.performance_calculator:Interpolation failed for pump 6 K 6 VANE at flow 342.0 - failed: ['head', 'efficiency', 'power', 'npshr'] (This is within the /api/chart_data_safe call)
WARNING:app.performance_calculator:No suitable curve found for 6 K 6 VANE
Analysis: When the /api/chart_data_safe endpoint is called for "6 K 6 VANE" (likely by Plotly.js on the detailed report page), it re-evaluates the pump. The "Insufficient curve points" warning is new and suggests that the curve_points list being passed to interpolate_value (within calculate_operating_point called by find_best_curve_for_duty within the API route) is empty or has < 2 points for all curves of "6 K 6 VANE".
This is strange because the initial evaluation for /pump-options did find an operating point for "6 K 6 VANE". This points to an inconsistency in how target_pump.curves is populated or accessed in the /api/chart_data_safe route versus the main selection logic.
Summary of Critical Findings from UI & Logs:
Impeller Size Not Displayed (N/Amm):
The operating_point dictionary logged for each pump does contain 'impeller_size': 'XXX.00'.
However, the UI cards (from screenshots of pump_options.html or similar) show "N/Amm".
The detailed report for "6 K 6 VANE" also shows "N/Amm" because selected_curve is {}.
Likely Cause: The template (pump_options.html or results_page.html for the cards, and professional_pump_report.html for the detail) is not correctly accessing this impeller_size from the data structure it receives. For the detailed report, the selected_curve object needs to be populated.
NPSH Required Display on Cards (0.0 m for pumps with no data):
The backend operating_point correctly has achieved_npshr_m': None for "6 K 6 VANE" and "5 K".
The UI cards show "0.0 m".
Cause: The template is likely using (value or 0)|float or |default(0.0) for NPSHr display.
Desired: Display "N/A" or "Data Unavailable" if achieved_npshr_m is None.
Overall Score Display:
UI shows "8500/100". Backend calculates e.g., 77.03.
Cause: Template is likely multiplying the score by 100 or there's a formatting error. It should just display the score, e.g., {{ top_selections[0].overall_score|round(1) }}.
Detailed Report for "6 K 6 VANE" Still Using 0.0 m³/hr Flow for Textual Reasoning:
Despite operating_point data (logged in console for this pump when it's passed to pump_report route) showing flow_m3hr: 342.0, the textual parts of the detailed report screenshot for "6 K 6 VANE" (e.g., "At a flow rate of 0.0 m³/hr...") are incorrect.
Cause: The report_context or the specific variables used to generate the narrative text in professional_pump_report.html are not correctly picking up the operating_point.flow_m3hr. It might be using a different, uninitialized flow variable.
selected_curve is Empty ({}) for "6 K 6 VANE" in Detailed Report Context:
INFO:app.routes:Template data - selected_pump selected_curve: {} when displaying report for "6 K 6 VANE".
Cause: The pump_report route, when preparing data for non-hardcoded pumps, is not correctly populating the selected_curve part of the selected_pump dictionary it passes to the template. It needs to get the best_curve_index from the evaluation and extract the corresponding curve details.
Chart API Fails for "6 K 6 VANE" (Insufficient Curve Points):
This is a new problem specific to the Chart API route. It suggests that when target_pump.curves is accessed within /api/chart_data_safe for "6 K 6 VANE", it might be empty or malformed, leading to interpolate_value getting too few points. This needs to be traced within that API endpoint's data loading/parsing for that specific pump.
Action Plan for Agent (Focus on Data Integrity for UI):
"Agent, thank you for these logs and the UI screenshots. We are making progress! The backend calculations for the operating points (Head, Efficiency, Power, correct NPSH as None when no data) and scores look much better in the console logs for the /pump-options request.
However, there are still discrepancies between this correct backend data and what's displayed in the UI, especially for 'Impeller Size' and how NPSH None is shown. The detailed report for '6 K 6 VANE' also has major issues.
Please focus on these critical data display and flow issues:
Fix Impeller Size Display (N/Amm):
In app/routes.py (for both /pump-options and /pump_report routes): Ensure the impeller_size from the calculated operating_point (e.g., operating_point['impeller_size']) is correctly passed to the respective templates (pump_options.html, professional_pump_report.html) as part of the top_selections or selected_pump data.
In the HTML Templates: Update the templates to correctly access and display this impeller_size. For example, if it's top_selections[0].operating_point.impeller_size, use that.
Display "N/A" for NPSH Required when Data is None:
In HTML Templates (pump_options.html, professional_pump_report.html): For displaying "NPSH Required," check if the value (e.g., pump.operating_point.achieved_npshr_m) is None. If it is, display "N/A" or "Data Unavailable" instead of "0.0 m".
<td>NPSH Required:</td>
<td><strong>{{ "%.1f m"|format(pump.operating_point.achieved_npshr_m) if pump.operating_point.achieved_npshr_m is not none else 'N/A' }}</strong></td>
Use code with caution.
Html
Correct Overall Score Display:
In HTML Templates: Ensure the overall score is displayed as a value out of 100, correctly formatted. Example: {{ pump.overall_score|round(1) }}. Remove any erroneous multiplication by 100.
Fix 0.0 m³/hr Flow in Detailed Report Text for "6 K 6 VANE":
In app/routes.py (pump_report route): When preparing context_data for professional_pump_report.html for a calculated pump (not the hardcoded 6/8 ALE):
Ensure that the site_requirements dictionary within context_data (or whichever variables are used to generate the narrative like "At a flow rate of...") are populated with the actual target flow (e.g., site_requirements_data.get('flow_m3hr', 342.0)).
Ensure the selected_pump.operating_point dictionary within context_data contains the correctly calculated values for the target flow.
The textual reasoning part of the template needs to use these correct flow values.
Populate selected_curve for Detailed Report:
In app/routes.py (pump_report route): When preparing context_data for a calculated pump:
After finding the selected_pump evaluation, retrieve its best_curve_index and operating_point.impeller_size.
Populate selected_pump['selected_curve'] with meaningful data, e.g.:
# Inside pump_report route, after finding selected_pump (which is an evaluation dict)
op_point = selected_pump.get('operating_point', {})
selected_pump['selected_curve'] = {
    'impeller_size': op_point.get('impeller_size', 'N/A'),
    'is_selected': True, # Or derive this based on which curve was best
    'curve_index': op_point.get('curve_index', -1)
}
Use code with caution.
Python
This will allow professional_pump_report.html to display the correct impeller.
Investigate Chart API Failure for "6 K 6 VANE" ("Insufficient curve points"):
In app/routes.py (get_chart_data_safe and get_chart_data routes):
When target_pump is found, add detailed logging to inspect the structure and content of target_pump.curves before calling find_best_curve_for_duty.
Is target_pump.curves empty or malformed specifically for "6 K 6 VANE" when accessed within this API route context? This could indicate an issue with how ParsedPumpData objects are being fetched or re-parsed in these API routes. Ensure consistent use of load_all_pump_data() and parse_pump_data() from pump_engine.
Priority:
Fix impeller size display (Item 1).
Fix 0.0 flow in detailed report text (Item 4) & Populate selected_curve (Item 5).
Fix NPSH "N/A" display (Item 2) & Score display (Item 3).
Investigate Chart API failure for "6 K 6 VANE" (Item 6).
Let's focus on making the data accurately flow to and display on the existing UI pages first."
