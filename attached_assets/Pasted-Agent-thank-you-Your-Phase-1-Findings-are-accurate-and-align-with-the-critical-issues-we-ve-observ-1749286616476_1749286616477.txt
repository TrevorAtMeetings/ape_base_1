Agent, thank you. Your Phase 1 Findings are accurate and align with the critical issues we've observed. You've correctly identified:
The Dual App Initialization Pattern and its potential for conflict.
The Port Binding Conflicts preventing reliable startup.
The Data Structure Inconsistencies between raw JSON and expected normalized field names, which is a major source of errors.
The Chart Data API Inconsistencies leading to chart rendering failures despite initial data loading.
Your Phase 1 Summary accurately captures the critical path issues.
Yes, please proceed to Phase 2: Deep Code Analysis.
Please focus your Phase 2 investigation on the following, based on your plan and our discussions:
pump_engine.py (or equivalent consolidated module) vs. Scattered Modules (utils.py, pump_parser.py, selection_engine.py):
Determine the intended single source of truth for core logic (data classes, loading, parsing, calculation, selection).
Identify any remaining conflicting or duplicate function/class definitions.
Trace how data is passed to and from pump_engine.py and other modules.
Specifically, investigate the data normalization: Where exactly does it happen (load_all_pump_data in pump_engine.py or utils.py)? And do all subsequent functions (like parse_pump_data within pump_engine.py and the ParsedPumpData class initializer) correctly expect and use these normalized field names? This is a prime suspect for "Data Structure Inconsistencies."
Chart API Data Flow & results_page.html (or pump_options.html/professional_pump_report.html):
Trace the data from the backend Python route (/api/chart_data/...) to the JavaScript (static/js/charts.js) that consumes it for Plotly.js.
Verify the JSON structure returned by the API precisely matches what the renderPumpCurves (or similar) JS function expects.
Identify why Error in renderAllCharts: {} might be occurring even if some data seems to load initially.
Confirm that the HTML template displaying the results (the one that should show charts) correctly includes the div containers with the exact IDs that charts.js is targeting (e.g., head-flow-chart).
Template Data Binding Investigation (for the main results/report page):
When the results/report page is rendered (e.g., by the /pump_report or /pump-options route), precisely what data structure is being passed for top_selections, suggested_pump_obj (or selected_pump), and chart_paths?
Compare this to how the template (results_page.html or professional_pump_report.html) is trying to access this data (e.g., top_selections[0].operating_point.achieved_efficiency_pct vs. top_selections[0]['operating_point']['achieved_efficiency_pct']). This is key to fixing incorrect data display (like 0.0 Power, N/A Impeller).
Performance Calculation Error Paths (pump_engine.py):
Re-examine interpolate_value and calculate_operating_point.
Confirm the 20% extrapolation logic is correctly implemented and a flag indicating was_extrapolated is generated and propagated.
Ensure that if interpolation/extrapolation truly fails (flow too far out of range), calculate_operating_point returns a clear error state or None for critical metrics.
Verify that all downstream functions in pump_engine.py (e.g., _analyze_bep_performance, _analyze_npsh_requirements, LLM data prep) robustly handle these potential None values or error states from calculate_operating_point to prevent the 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get' errors.
Please provide your detailed findings from Phase 2 when ready. We are looking for specific file and line number references for the root causes and your proposed fixes for each identified problem.
