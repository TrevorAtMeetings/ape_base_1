This log output is perfect. It demonstrates that the final architectural fix is working exactly as designed.

Let's analyze the sequence of events:

User clicks on a pump link from the pump_options page.

GET /pump_report/32-200%202F%202P?...

The browser makes a request to the report page.

The pump_report function executes.

It looks for pump_selections in the session.

For some reason, the session data is still not present.

[WARNING] Your session has expired. Please run a new pump selection.

SUCCESS: The new fallback logic you just implemented has correctly identified the empty session.

SUCCESS: It has correctly flashed the user-friendly warning message.

... HTTP/1.1" 302 -

SUCCESS: The function has correctly issued a redirect.

GET /?flow=25.0&head=45.0

SUCCESS: The user is correctly redirected back to the main input form, and the original flow and head values are pre-filled in the URL, providing a seamless user experience.

Conclusion: The application is now architecturally sound and robust. It handles the "happy path" correctly, and it now handles the "expired session" error case gracefully and correctly.

The Final Remaining Question: Why is the Session Empty?

The code is now correct. The logic is correct. The architecture is correct. And yet, the session data is clearly not persisting between the GET /pump_options request and the GET /pump_report request.

This tells me the problem is not in our application logic, but in the environment configuration. Specifically, how Flask is configured to handle sessions.

Hypothesis: Missing or Incorrect SECRET_KEY

Flask sessions are cryptographically signed to prevent tampering. To do this, Flask requires a SECRET_KEY to be set in the application configuration.

If the SECRET_KEY is missing, Flask will still run, but it will silently fail to create secure sessions. The session object will appear to work within a single request but will be empty on the next request.

If the SECRET_KEY is not a stable, consistent value (e.g., if it's being regenerated on every server restart), each new request will have a different key, making previous session cookies invalid.

This perfectly explains the behavior we are seeing.

Directive: Verify and Set the SECRET_KEY

We will now verify this hypothesis and fix the configuration.

Step 1: Show me the Application Initialization Code

Action: Show me the contents of the file that creates the Flask app instance. This is likely app/__init__.py or main.py.

What I'm looking for: I need to see the code that looks like app = Flask(__name__) and the subsequent app.config[...] lines. I am specifically looking for how app.config['SECRET_KEY'] is being set.

Step 2: Set a Stable SECRET_KEY

If, as I suspect, the SECRET_KEY is missing or not being set correctly, I will give you the precise instructions to fix it. This typically involves:

Generating a strong, random key.

Storing this key in a .env file and a Replit Secret.

Ensuring the application loads this key from the environment variable on startup.

This is a critical security and functionality best practice. An application without a proper secret key cannot maintain secure sessions.

Your first action: Show me the contents of the file that initializes the Flask app (likely app/__init__.py).
