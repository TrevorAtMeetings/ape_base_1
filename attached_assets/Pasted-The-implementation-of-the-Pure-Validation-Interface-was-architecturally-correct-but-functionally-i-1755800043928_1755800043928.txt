The implementation of the "Pure Validation Interface" was architecturally correct but functionally incomplete. The user has rightly pointed out that by stripping away all analytical tools, we have created a "dead end" that is not useful for an engineering workflow.
We will now enhance this interface, evolving it from a simple validator into a comprehensive "Analytical Workbench." The "Truth Gate" we built will remain as the first step, but it will now unlock a suite of diagnostic tools.
The New User Experience Flow:
User enters data and clicks "Analyze Calibration."
The system performs the "Pure Validation" using the Forced Constraint method.
The results page will now be structured in three distinct sections:
Section 1: The "Truth Gate" - The Stark Comparison (Keep As-Is)
This is the Validation Results box that currently exists. It provides the immediate, high-level answer: "Is there a problem? Yes or No."
Action: No changes are needed here. This serves as the initial gate.
Section 2: The "Analytical Workbench" - Granular Analysis (NEW BUILD)
This new section will appear directly below the "Truth Gate." Its title will be "Discrepancy Analysis." This is where we re-introduce the tools an engineer needs.
Task 2.1: Implement the Detailed Delta Table
This directly addresses the need for "deltas per output area."
Create a new table that compares the user's submitted points against the Brain's prediction for each key performance indicator.
Table Columns:
Flow (mÂ³/hr)
Your Head (m)
Brain's Head (m)
Head Delta (%) (Displayed in red/green)
Your Efficiency (%)
Brain's Efficiency (%)
Efficiency Delta (%) (Displayed in red/green)
(Add Power if applicable)
Task 2.2: Re-implement the Visual Comparison Charts
This is the most critical tool for an engineer.
Generate a chart that visually overlays the two performance curves:
The User's Curve: Plot the data points provided by the user.
The Brain's Predicted Curve: This is generated by calling our core calculate_performance_at_flow engine multiple times across a range of flow points, using the user's single forced_diameter. This shows what our engine predicts the full curve should look like for that exact impeller.
The chart must clearly show how the curves align or diverge, allowing the engineer to instantly see if the discrepancy is at low flow, high flow, or across the entire operational range.
Section 3: The "Informed Decision" - Empowered User Action (REPOSITION)
This is the final section at the bottom of the page, titled "Decision Required."
Action: Move the two decision buttons ("Discard - My Input Data is Incorrect" and "Flag for Engineering Review") to this final position.
By placing these buttons after the detailed table and the visual charts, they are no longer a "dead end." They are an informed choice that the user can now make with confidence, having been equipped with a full suite of analytical evidence.
This new structure respects our core architectural principle (the single source of truth via Forced Constraint) while providing the rich, insightful, and actionable interface that an expert user demands. It transforms the tool from a simple gatekeeper into a powerful diagnostic partner.
Please implement these enhancements immediately.
