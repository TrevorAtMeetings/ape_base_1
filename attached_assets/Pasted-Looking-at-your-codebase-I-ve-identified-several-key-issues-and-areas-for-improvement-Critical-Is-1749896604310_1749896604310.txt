Looking at your codebase, I've identified several key issues and areas for improvement:

Critical Issues
1. Unused Dependencies & Package Bloat
Your pyproject.toml contains hundreds of ML/AI packages that aren't used in this pump selection application:

TensorFlow, PyTorch, and related packages
Computer vision libraries (OpenCV, PIL variants)
Deep learning frameworks
Audio/video processing libraries
Impact: Significantly increases deployment size and startup time.

2. Logic Issues in Core Functions
Power Calculation Inconsistency (static/js/charts.js):

// Line 295 - Power calculation may fail with None values
powers = calculate_power_curve(performance_points);
The function doesn't handle power_kw: None cases from catalog data.

NPSH Data Handling (app/routes.py):

# Lines 1050+ - Conflicting NPSH availability logs
INFO:app.routes:No NPSH data available for pump BDM 16/14
# But catalog shows: 'has_npsh_data': True, 'npsh_range_m': '3.2-17.0'
3. Session Data Inefficiencies
Large pump selection objects stored in Flask sessions could cause cookie overflow:

# routes.py line 656 - Storing full pump curves in session
session['pump_selections'] = [complex_pump_data...]
4. Error Handling Gaps
PDF Generation (pdf_generator.py):

# Missing validation for None operating points
operating_point = selected_pump.get('operating_point', {})
# Should validate required fields exist
Chart API (app/routes.py):

# Line 2455 - Unsafe base64 decoding
pump_code = base64.b64decode(safe_pump_code).decode('utf-8')
# No exception handling for malformed input
Logic Flow Issues
1. Duplicate Chart Loading
Console logs show charts loading multiple times:

Charts.js: loadChartData called with: {"pumpCode":"BDM 16/14"...}
Charts.js: loadChartData called with: {"pumpCode":"BDM 16/14"...}
2. Inconsistent Data Flow
Catalog engine returns power_kw: None
JavaScript calculates power using hydraulic formula
PDF generator expects actual power values
Results in calculation mismatches
3. Memory Leaks Potential
Chart cache in static/js/charts.js grows indefinitely:

let chartDataCache = {};
// No cleanup mechanism
Security Concerns
1. Input Validation
# routes.py - Weak validation
if flow_str.lower() in ('nan', 'infinity', 'inf', '-inf'):
# Should use proper numeric validation
2. File Path Handling
# Multiple locations - Unbound variable risks
if 'temp_path' in locals() and temp_path and os.path.exists(temp_path):
Performance Issues
1. Database Queries
Catalog engine loads all 386 pumps on every request:

INFO:catalog_engine:Loaded 386 pump models from catalog
# Should implement caching
2. Redundant API Calls
Same chart data requested multiple times per page load.

Recommendations
Immediate Fixes
Clean pyproject.toml - Remove unused ML packages
Add power data validation in chart calculations
Implement proper error boundaries for PDF generation
Add input sanitization for pump codes and parameters
Architecture Improvements
Implement Redis/memory cache for catalog data
Add request deduplication for chart API
Use database sessions instead of Flask sessions for large data
Add proper logging levels (too much INFO logging in production)
Code Quality
Add type hints consistently across modules
Implement proper exception hierarchies
Add unit tests for critical calculation functions
Use dependency injection for better testability
The application is functional but needs optimization for production reliability and performance.
