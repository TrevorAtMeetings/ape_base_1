Critical Issues Revealed:
NEW CRITICAL ERROR: TypeError: must be real number, not NoneType in /pump-options route
ERROR:app.routes:Error in pump_options: must be real number, not NoneType
Analysis: This TypeError typically occurs when a mathematical operation (like addition, multiplication, comparison) or a function expecting a number (like float(), int(), or functions in math or numpy) receives a None value instead.
Location: It's happening within the /pump-options route in app/routes.py. This is the route that now handles the form submission (via GET) and is supposed to display the pump selection options (what results_page.html used to do, or what pump_options.html is now for).
Likely Cause (Connected to Extrapolation/Interpolation):
Even though the interpolate_value function is attempting extrapolation, it might still be returning None for some metrics if:
The scipy.interpolate.interp1d with fill_value="extrapolate" (if that's what it's using now) itself fails for some reason (e.g., not enough data points for stable extrapolation).
The fallback _linear_interpolate is hit and it cannot extrapolate (it usually returns boundary values or could return None if not handled carefully at edges).
The curve_points list passed to interpolate_value is empty or has only one point for a specific metric (e.g., if NPSH data was missing or all zeros and filtered out).
The calculate_operating_point function might then receive these None values.
Crucially, even if calculate_operating_point returns an operating_point dictionary with some None values, the downstream code in the /pump-options route (or functions it calls from pump_engine.py like find_best_pumps or the scoring functions) is trying to use one of these None values in a numerical context.
For example, if achieved_efficiency_pct is None, and the scoring logic tries score = achieved_head_accuracy * 0.6 + achieved_efficiency_pct * 0.4, this would raise the TypeError.
Persistent NoneType Errors in selection_engine (Though not in this specific request trace after the TypeError):
The previous logs showed ERROR:app.selection_engine:Error generating reasoning: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'.
Analysis: While the TypeError in /pump-options stops the request before it gets too far into the template rendering that might have triggered this again, the root cause (invalid operating points with None values being passed to detailed analysis functions) likely still needs hardening. Fixing the TypeError in the numerical processing part of the selection might expose these again if not all paths are robust to None.
Data for Extrapolation:
The extrapolation warnings are good, but we still don't know if the was_extrapolated flag is being generated by interpolate_value and propagated into the operating_point dictionary. This is needed for UI differentiation.
Debugging & Refinement Instructions for the Agent:
The immediate priority is to fix the TypeError in the /pump-options route.
Fix TypeError: must be real number, not NoneType in /pump-options (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
Instruction to Agent: "Agent, the /pump-options route is crashing with TypeError: must be real number, not NoneType. This is happening after the extrapolation warnings.
Step 1: Detailed Logging in pump_engine.py (or performance_calculator.py):
Inside interpolate_value: Before returning, log the target_x and the result it's about to return, especially if it's None.
Inside calculate_operating_point: Log the target_flow. For each metric (head, efficiency, power, npshr), log the value returned by interpolate_value before any fallbacks or conservative estimates are applied. Then log the final operating_point dictionary being returned.
Inside find_best_curve_for_duty: Log the operating_point received from calculate_operating_point for each curve.
Inside evaluate_pump_for_requirements (or the main evaluation function called by find_best_pumps): Log the operating_point for the selected best curve.
Inside calculate_pump_suitability_score (or similar scoring functions): Log all numerical inputs to scoring calculations (e.g., achieved_head, achieved_eff, and any sub-scores like head_accuracy, efficiency_score).
Step 2: Run the Test Case Again: Submit the form with Flow=342, Head=27.4.
Step 3: Analyze Logs: Carefully examine the logs to pinpoint which numerical variable becomes None and is then used in a mathematical operation within the /pump-options route's processing chain (which includes calls into pump_engine.py).
Step 4: Implement Robust None Checks: Before any mathematical operation or function call that expects a number, check if the input variable is None. If it is, assign a sensible default (e.g., 0.0, but be aware this can skew results), or skip that part of the calculation and flag that the metric is unavailable, or assign a very low score for that component. For example, if achieved_efficiency_pct is None, the overall score should be heavily penalized or that pump deemed unsuitable.
# Example in scoring logic:
achieved_eff = operating_point.get('achieved_efficiency_pct')
if achieved_eff is None:
    efficiency_score = 0 # Or a large penalty
    logger.warning(f"Efficiency is None for pump {parsed_pump.pump_code}, assigning zero efficiency score.")
else:
    efficiency_score = min(100, achieved_eff)
# ...
# overall_score = (head_accuracy or 0) * 0.6 + (efficiency_score or 0) * 0.4
Use code with caution.
Python
The goal is to prevent the TypeError by ensuring all inputs to numerical operations are actual numbers."
Implement/Verify was_extrapolated Flag (After TypeError is fixed):
Instruction to Agent: "Once the TypeError is resolved, please ensure:
interpolate_value in pump_engine.py returns a tuple/dictionary: (value, was_extrapolated_boolean).
calculate_operating_point captures these boolean flags for each metric (head, efficiency, power, npshr) and includes them in its returned operating_point dictionary (e.g., head_was_extrapolated: True).
This operating_point dictionary (with extrapolation flags) is correctly passed through find_best_pumps to app/routes.py and then to the template context for pump_options.html (or the results display template)."
Graceful Handling of None in Analysis Functions (Reiterate):
Instruction to Agent: "In pump_engine.py, ensure all detailed analysis functions (_analyze_bep_performance, _analyze_npsh_requirements, etc.) and the LLM data preparation steps robustly check for None values in the operating_point data. If essential data is None, these functions should return default structures indicating 'Data Not Available' or skip the analysis for that component, rather than attempting to process None."
Focus Order:
Fix the TypeError in /pump-options by adding robust None checks before numerical operations in the scoring/evaluation logic within pump_engine.py. This likely means calculate_operating_point is returning None for some key metrics more often than anticipated, even with extrapolation attempts.
Ensure the was_extrapolated flags are correctly generated and propagated.
