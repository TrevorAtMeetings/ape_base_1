You have not yet implemented the fix I directed. The logs clearly show the architectural flaw is still present:
INFO:app.route_modules.reports: Template data - Looking for pump_code: '32-200 2F 2P' in 0 selections
Proof: The session data is empty. The results from the selection engine were not saved.
INFO:app.route_modules.reports: Recalculated overall_score from breakdown: 68.8
Proof: The report module is running its own incorrect scoring logic. The real score was 85.7.
We cannot proceed to Phase 2 (Frontend) until this fundamental data flow is fixed. The application must have a single source of truth.
Directive: Implement the Data Flow Fix (Final Instruction)
This is the final time I will issue this directive. The next step is to fix the data flow between the selection route and the report route.
Your task is to modify app/route_modules/main_flow.py and app/route_modules/reports.py.
Step 1: In app/route_modules/main_flow.py
Locate the function that handles the /pump_options route (or wherever select_pumps is called).
Find the line where you get the formatted_results from the catalog_engine.
Immediately after that line, add this code to save the complete, correct results to the user's session:
Generated python
from flask import session

# ... after getting results from catalog_engine ...
session['pump_selections'] = formatted_results
session['exclusion_summary'] = exclusion_data.get('exclusion_summary', {})
# Also save other relevant data like total_evaluated, etc.
Use code with caution.
Python
Step 2: In app/route_modules/reports.py
Locate the pump_report function.
DELETE all the code inside this function that performs calculations. This includes any calls to catalog_engine, any logic that creates a score_breakdown, and any "Last chance" calculations.
REPLACE it with the following logic:
Generated python
from flask import session, redirect, url_for, request, render_template
from .helpers import safe_session_get # Make sure you have this helper

@reports_bp.route('/pump_report/<pump_code>')
def pump_report(pump_code):
    # Get the required flow and head from the URL for context
    flow = request.args.get('flow')
    head = request.args.get('head')

    # Get the TRUE results from the session
    pump_selections = safe_session_get('pump_selections', [])

    selected_pump = None
    for pump in pump_selections:
        if pump['pump_code'] == pump_code:
            selected_pump = pump
            break

    if not selected_pump:
        # FALLBACK: If session data is missing, redirect to the start.
        # This forces a re-run of the correct logic.
        # DO NOT try to recalculate here.
        return redirect(url_for('main_flow.index', flow=flow, head=head, error="session_expired"))

    # The selected_pump object is now the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH.
    # It contains the correct score and performance data calculated by the engine.
    
    # Pass this correct object directly to the template.
    return render_template(
        'professional_pump_report.html',
        selected_pump=selected_pump,
        # ... pass other necessary data like exclusion_summary from session ...
    )
Use code with caution.
Python
This is the final architectural fix required for the backend. Once this is done, the data will flow correctly through the application, and we can finally move on to fixing the frontend charts.
Proceed with this implementation now.
