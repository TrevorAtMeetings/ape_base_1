Let's break down the errors:
Error 1 & 3 (Plotly.js Version Warning):
WARNING: plotly-latest.min.js and plotly-latest.js are NO LONGER the latest releases of plotly.js. They are v1.58.5 (released July 2021)...
Analysis: This is a warning from Plotly itself. You're using an outdated CDN link for Plotly.js (v1.x). While it might still work for basic charts, it's best to update to a more recent v2.x version for the latest features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.
Impact: Not a critical crash, but good practice to update.
Instruction to Agent: "Agent, please update the Plotly.js CDN link in base.html (or wherever it's included) to a more recent stable version (e.g., from https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-2.X.X.min.js - check the Plotly GitHub releases page for the latest version number). For example, the latest is currently around v2.32.0: https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-2.32.0.min.js."
Error 2: Charts.js: Error in renderAllCharts: Error: No DOM element with id 'head-flow-chart' exists on the page.
File: static/js/charts.js (within a function likely called renderAllCharts or similar, which then calls individual chart rendering functions).
Problem: The JavaScript code in charts.js is trying to find an HTML element with the ID head-flow-chart to render the head-flow chart into, but no such element exists on the currently loaded HTML page (likely results_page.html or pump_report.html).
Impact: The head-flow chart (and likely others if they follow the same pattern) will not be rendered.
Possible Causes & Fixes:
Typo in HTML ID: The div in your HTML template might have a slightly different ID (e.g., headFlowChart, head_flow_chart, head-chart).
Typo in JavaScript ID: The charts.js code might be looking for the wrong ID.
HTML Element Not Loaded Yet: The JavaScript might be executing before the HTML element with that ID is fully loaded into the DOM. (Wrapping JS in DOMContentLoaded usually prevents this, and the agent's previous input_form.html JS used this).
Conditional Rendering in HTML: The div for the chart might be inside an {% if %} block in the Jinja2 template that is evaluating to false, so the div is never rendered.
Instruction to Agent:
"Agent, we have an error: No DOM element with id 'head-flow-chart' exists on the page.
Step 1: Please verify the HTML template that is supposed to display the interactive charts (likely results_page.html or professional_pump_report.html or a dedicated pump_options.html). Ensure there is a <div> element with the exact ID head-flow-chart. For example: <div id="head-flow-chart" style="width:100%;height:400px;"></div>.
Step 2: In static/js/charts.js, verify that the code attempting to render the head-flow chart (e.g., inside PumpChartsManager.renderHeadFlowChart or Plotly.newPlot) is using the exact same ID head-flow-chart.
Step 3: Ensure that the JavaScript code that calls renderAllCharts or the individual chart rendering functions is executed after the DOM is fully loaded (e.g., within a document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() { ... }); block)."
Step 4: Check if the chart container divs are conditionally rendered in the Jinja2 template (e.g., inside {% if chart_data %}). If so, ensure the condition is true when charts are expected.
Error 4: Error loading chart data: Error: No DOM element with id 'headFlowChart' exists on the page. (Similar to Error 2 but from a different call stack)
at Plotly.newPlot (chart_legend_fix.js:30:32)
at PumpChartsManager.renderHeadFlowChart (charts.js:121:16)
This error trace indicates the problem is specifically when Plotly.newPlot is called. It seems there's a discrepancy in the ID being used or expected.
Error 2 mentioned 'head-flow-chart'.
Error 4 mentions 'headFlowChart' (camelCase).
This strongly suggests a simple typo or inconsistency in the ID naming between the HTML template and the JavaScript code.
Instruction to Agent (Reinforce previous instruction):
"Agent, the console shows errors for both 'head-flow-chart' and 'headFlowChart'. Please standardize the ID for the head-flow chart container in both the HTML template (e.g., results_page.html or professional_pump_report.html) and in all relevant JavaScript files (charts.js, chart_legend_fix.js if that's a separate file you're using). For consistency, let's use hyphenated IDs like head-flow-chart, efficiency-chart, power-chart, npsh-chart in both HTML and JavaScript."
Summary of Issues and Next Steps for Agent:
The primary problem is that the JavaScript code responsible for rendering the Plotly.js interactive charts cannot find the HTML div elements it's supposed to draw into. This is almost always due to a mismatch in IDs or the JS running before the HTML is ready.
Consolidated Instructions for the Agent:
"Agent, the browser console shows errors related to the Plotly.js interactive charts.
Standardize Chart Container IDs:
In the HTML template where the interactive charts are meant to be displayed (e.g., results_page.html or professional_pump_report.html), ensure you have div elements with the following exact IDs:
id="head-flow-chart"
id="efficiency-chart"
id="power-chart"
id="npsh-chart"
In all relevant JavaScript files (e.g., static/js/charts.js, and chart_legend_fix.js if it's involved in plotting), make sure that when Plotly.newPlot (or similar Plotly functions) are called, they target these exact, hyphenated IDs. Correct any discrepancies (e.g., if JS is looking for headFlowChart but HTML has head-flow-chart).
Ensure DOM Readiness:
In static/js/charts.js (or your main JS file that initializes the charts), ensure that the functions responsible for rendering the Plotly charts (e.g., renderAllCharts or individual renderHeadFlowChart calls) are executed only after the HTML DOM is fully loaded. Wrap the initialization calls in:
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // Your chart initialization and rendering calls here
    // e.g., initializePumpCharts();
    // e.g., PumpChartsManager.renderAllCharts(chartDataFromPython);
});
Use code with caution.
JavaScript
Update Plotly.js CDN Link (Lower Priority but Good Practice):
In base.html (or wherever Plotly.js is included), update the script tag from plotly-latest.min.js to a specific recent version, for example:
<script src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-2.32.0.min.js"></script>
(Verify the latest stable version number from the Plotly.js GitHub releases page.)
After making these changes, please test the page where the interactive charts are supposed to appear. Verify that:
The Plotly version warning is gone (if CDN updated).
The "No DOM element with id..." errors are resolved.
All four interactive charts (Head, Efficiency, Power, NPSH) are rendered on the page with actual data."
This focused approach should resolve the chart rendering issues. The typo between hyphenated and camelCase IDs is a very common mistake.
