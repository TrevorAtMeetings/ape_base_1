The new critical issue is a Gunicorn WORKER TIMEOUT which then leads to a SystemExit: 1, causing the worker to exit and restart. This timeout is happening during the processing of the /results request, specifically when making calls to the OpenAI API.
Let's break this down:
Key Observations & Analysis:
Successful Startup & Initial Processing:
Gunicorn starts, workers boot.
Flask app initializes, configures, LLM reasoning module initializes.
Routes are imported.
The /results request for Flow=150, Head=45 is received.
Pump data is loaded (18 pumps).
Pumps are parsed.
The selection engine starts evaluating pumps.
Previous Issues Still Present (but not the primary crash cause now):
WARNING:app.performance_calculator:Target flow 150.0 outside curve range [...]
WARNING:app.performance_calculator:No suitable curve found for [...]
ERROR:app.selection_engine:Error in BEP analysis: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get' (and similar for NPSH, power, reasoning)
Implication: The robust handling for out-of-range flows and None types in the selection engine, which we discussed, is either not fully implemented or some edge cases are still causing None to propagate where an error/skip was expected. This needs to be revisited, but it's not the direct cause of the Gunicorn timeout.
LLM API Calls are Being Made:
INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" (This repeats many times before the timeout).
This is where the problem lies. The application is successfully making multiple calls to the OpenAI API.
Gunicorn Worker Timeout:
[2025-06-06 20:07:53 +0000] [20119] [CRITICAL] WORKER TIMEOUT (pid:20369)
Gunicorn has a default timeout for how long a worker can take to process a request. If the request processing (including all synchronous operations like API calls) exceeds this timeout, Gunicorn kills the worker. The default is often 30 seconds.
The traceback that follows the timeout shows the call stack at the moment the worker was killed. It's deep within the httpx library (used by the openai client) trying to read a response from the SSL socket for the OpenAI API call.
File "/home/runner/workspace/app/selection_engine.py", line 59, in find_best_pumps technical_analysis = llm_reasoning.generate_technical_analysis(evaluation, parsed_pump)
File "/home/runner/workspace/app/llm_reasoning.py", line 133, in generate_technical_analysis bep_result = self._call_llm_api(system_prompt, bep_prompt, 200)
File "/home/runner/workspace/app/llm_reasoning.py", line 169, in _call_llm_api response = self.openai_client.chat.completions.create(...)
Conclusion: The synchronous calls to the OpenAI API within the find_best_pumps loop (likely for each of the "7 suitable pumps" or Top 3) are taking too long collectively, exceeding Gunicorn's worker timeout.
SystemExit: 1 and Worker Restart:
Gunicorn's way of handling a timed-out worker is to kill it and start a new one. This is why you see the app re-initializing after the crash.
Primary Cause of "Crash": Synchronous, potentially lengthy OpenAI API calls within a single web request handler are exceeding Gunicorn's worker timeout.
Solutions & Instructions for the Agent:
The agent needs to address the OpenAI API call strategy.
Reduce Number of LLM Calls / Make them Asynchronous (Harder in current sync Flask):
A. Batch Prompts (If Feasible): If you're making similar calls for BEP, NPSH, Power analysis for the same pump, can these be combined into a single, more complex prompt to the LLM to get all analyses in one go? This would reduce the number of network round trips.
B. Call LLM Only for Top Selected Pump (Initially): Instead of generating LLM reasoning for all suitable pumps or even Top 3 during the initial selection process, perhaps only generate it on-demand when the user views a detailed report, or only for the single top recommended pump.
Instruction to Agent: "Modify the selection_engine.py and llm_reasoning.py. For the initial results page (/results), let's temporarily disable or significantly limit the calls to the LLM.
Option 1 (Disable for now): Comment out the calls to llm_reasoning.generate_technical_analysis within the find_best_pumps loop or the part that iterates through the top selections. Use placeholder/template-based reasoning for the results_page.html. We will re-introduce LLM reasoning for the detailed PDF report or as an on-demand feature.
Option 2 (Limit to Top 1): Only call the LLM for the single, top-ranked pump after the Top 3 are determined, not for all of them during the scoring/evaluation loop.
This will reduce the number of synchronous API calls during the /results request."
Increase Gunicorn Worker Timeout (Workaround, Not Ideal Long-Term):
You can increase Gunicorn's timeout if the LLM calls are inherently a bit slow but usually complete. This gives more time but doesn't fix the underlying issue of long-running synchronous tasks in a web worker.
Instruction to Agent: "In the .replit file, modify the Gunicorn commands to include a longer timeout. For example, --timeout 120 (for 120 seconds):
# In [deployment]
run = ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8080", "--timeout", "120", "app:app"] # Or main:app

# In [[workflows.workflow]] name = "Start application" -> [[workflows.workflow.tasks]]
args = "gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8080 --reuse-port --reload --timeout 120 app:app" # Or main:app
Use code with caution.
Toml
Caution: This is a temporary fix. If LLM calls are very slow, it will still lead to a poor user experience as they wait for the page to load.
Asynchronous Task Processing (More Advanced, Future Iteration):
For a truly robust solution where LLM calls might take time, the LLM reasoning generation should be offloaded to a background task queue (e.g., Celery, RQ) and the user interface updated when the results are ready (e.g., via polling or WebSockets). This is likely beyond the scope of the "Initial Version" for the AI agent but is the proper long-term fix for potentially slow external API calls in a web app.
Note for Master Plan: This should be noted as a potential future enhancement for performance and scalability if LLM calls remain a bottleneck.
Optimize LLM Prompts & Usage:
Ensure prompts are concise.
Request shorter responses from the LLM (max_tokens) if full elaborate paragraphs aren't always needed for every piece of analysis.
Consider if a cheaper/faster LLM model can be used for some of the analysis if a premium model is causing slowness.
Still Address the NoneType Errors:
Instruction to Agent: "Even though the Gunicorn timeout is the immediate crash cause, please also revisit selection_engine.py and performance_calculator.py to ensure that if calculate_operating_point returns an error or None for essential values (due to flow being out of range even for extrapolation), the subsequent BEP, NPSH, Power analysis, and reasoning generation steps gracefully handle this for that specific pump/curve. They should either skip analysis for that invalid point or return a clear 'Data Not Available' status instead of attempting operations on None and causing AttributeErrors. This will make the logs cleaner and the system more robust."
Immediate Priority for the Agent:
Temporarily Disable or Drastically Limit LLM Calls in the /results Request Path: This is the quickest way to stop the Gunicorn timeouts and get the rest of the application (selection, basic results page, static charts) working.
Then, thoroughly implement the robust handling of out-of-range flows and None values in the performance calculation and selection engine to clean up the WARNINGs and ERRORs related to NoneType.
