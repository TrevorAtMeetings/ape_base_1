Bug #1: Data Key Mismatch (FIXED by Agent)
Symptom: The agent correctly found an error: ERROR: 'dict object' has no attribute 'achieved_efficiency_pct'.
Root Cause: The comparison.py route was passing the raw Brain evaluation dictionary to the template, but the pump_comparison.html template was written for the old legacy data structure, which used different key names (e.g., achieved_efficiency_pct instead of efficiency_pct).
Agent's Fix: The agent created a mapping to translate the Brain's clean data structure into the old, messy format the template was expecting.
Assessment of Fix: This is a pragmatic but temporary fix. It's a form of technical debt known as an "Adapter Pattern." It makes the page work for now, but the real solution is to refactor the template itself.
The New, Deeper Problem (Why it Still Fails)
The agent fixed the template rendering, but now it's hitting the next bug in the chain. The console log from the user's latest test gives us the final clue:
Console Log Evidence:
code
Code
Console.js:61 API response received: 200
Console.js:61 Pump data received: 386 pumps
This confirms that the /api/pump_list endpoint is working. However, this is likely for a dropdown menu. The core functionality of the comparison page itself is still broken.
The agent's next action provides the answer:
Traced comparison feature failure (4 seconds)
I need to systematically trace through the entire comparison workflow...
Opened templates/pump_comparison.html
The agent is now looking at the template, which is the right place to look. But the problem isn't just the template; it's the entire data flow leading up to it.
The Real Root Cause:
I need to refer back to my previous analysis of the files. The agent fixed the template rendering, but it likely did not yet fix the core logic in comparison_api.py and comparison.py.
comparison_api.py is Still Bypassing the Brain:
The add_to_comparison function is likely still using the old PumpRepository to get raw, unevaluated pump data and is stuffing this large, raw object into the session. It never calls brain.evaluate_pump.
comparison.py is Using Stale, Raw Data:
The route that renders the /compare page is reading this raw, unevaluated data from the session. It isn't calling the Brain to get fresh, accurate performance data for the pumps at the specified duty points.
The Template Fails (Again):
Even with the agent's key-mapping fix, the template is still receiving data that is incomplete. It's missing all the rich performance data that only the Brain can calculate (efficiency, power, trim %, score, etc.). This will lead to empty fields, nan values, or other rendering errors.
Action Plan: The Definitive "Brain-Only" Refactor for Comparison
We need to instruct the agent to perform the full refactor we planned previously. The partial fix was not enough.
Please provide the following prompt to the agent:
Prompt for the Agent:
Agent, your previous fix for the template key mismatch was a good step, but the comparison feature is still failing because the underlying data logic is still using a decommissioned, legacy pattern.
We need to perform a complete, end-to-end refactor of the entire comparison feature to make it fully "Brain-Only." Please follow these steps precisely.
Step 1: Refactor the API for Adding Pumps (comparison_api.py)
Open: app/route_modules/comparison_api.py.
Rewrite the add_to_comparison function:
The function should accept pump_code, flow, and head.
It must remove all code that calls the PumpRepository.
It should only store a minimal dictionary in the session's comparison_list. The session should only contain a list of what to compare, not the data itself.
Example of what to store in the session: [{'pump_code': '8K', 'flow': 350.0, 'head': 50.0}]
Step 2: Refactor the Comparison Page Route (comparison.py)
Open: app/route_modules/comparison.py (or wherever the route for /compare is located).
Rewrite the main route function (compare_page):
Get the list of identifiers from session['comparison_list'].
If the list is empty, render the page with a "Please add pumps" message.
If the list is not empty, create an empty list called evaluated_pumps.
Loop through the list of identifiers. Inside the loop, for each item, make a call to brain.evaluate_pump(item['pump_code'], item['flow'], item['head']).
Append the full, rich result from the Brain to the evaluated_pumps list.
Pass the evaluated_pumps list to the pump_comparison.html template. This list will now contain complete, accurate, and consistently structured data.
Step 3: Refactor the Comparison Template (pump_comparison.html)
Open: app/templates/pump_comparison.html.
Remove all temporary fixes and adapters. The template will now receive a clean list of pump objects directly from the Brain.
Update all variable names to match the Brain's output schema (e.g., use pump.efficiency_pct, pump.total_score, pump.score_components.bep_proximity, etc.). This will eliminate the need for any mapping or translation.
This end-to-end refactor will fix the feature by ensuring a clean, modern, and Brain-powered data flow from start to finish. It will remove all dependencies on legacy code and fix the root cause of the failures.
