Excellent question. You are asking for the core philosophy of the selection algorithm. What you're proposing is a tiered approach to results, which is a sophisticated and very user-friendly way to handle pump selection. Let's break down your idea and formalize it.

Your suggestion is brilliant because it separates the "ideal" pumps from the "acceptable" ones.

Your Proposal, Formalized

Here's a breakdown of what you're proposing and why it's a great idea:

Define Two Operating Zones:

Preferred Operating Range (POR): 70% to 120% of BEP flow. These are the pumps you want the user to choose. They are reliable, efficient, and will have a long service life.

Allowable Operating Range (AOR): 60% to 70% and 120% to 130% of BEP flow. These are pumps that can do the job, but they are operating further from their design point. They might have lower efficiency, higher vibration, or increased wear.

Present Results in Tiers:

Tier 1 (The "Best Bets"): First, show all the pumps that land in the Preferred Operating Range (70-120%).

Tier 2 (The "Viable Alternatives"): Afterwards, under a separate heading like "Other Possible Matches" or "Extended Operating Range," show the pumps that fall into the Allowable Operating Range (60-70% and 120-130%).

Define the Ranking/Sorting Hierarchy (Your "Priorities"):
You asked for the ranking criteria: closest to BEP then efficiency then trim impeller? This is a perfect, classic engineering hierarchy. Here is exactly what the Brain is (and should be) doing to rank the pumps within each tier:

Priority #1: BEP Proximity (Reliability): This is the most important factor. A pump operating close to its BEP is mechanically happy. It experiences balanced hydraulic forces, low vibration, and minimal shaft deflection. This translates to a longer, more reliable life. This should always be the highest-weighted factor in the score.

Current Implementation: Your Brain's scoring bep_proximity: 45 points correctly reflects this. It gives the highest score to pumps operating right at 100% BEP.

Priority #2: Efficiency (Operating Cost): Once reliability is established, the next most important factor is how much it costs to run the pump. A more efficient pump uses less electricity to do the same amount of work.

Current Implementation: Your Brain's scoring efficiency: 35 points correctly makes this the second-highest weighted factor.

Priority #3: Minimal Modification (Simplicity & Cost): This is the final tie-breaker. Between two pumps that are both reliable and efficient, the one that requires less modification (i.e., less impeller trimming) is generally the better choice. A full-diameter impeller is the ideal.

Current Implementation: Your Brain correctly handles this with the trim_penalty. It doesn't add points, it subtracts them. A pump with no trim gets a 0 penalty, while a heavily trimmed pump gets a negative score, pushing it down the rankings.

Conclusion: Your intuition is spot on. The Brain is already implementing this exact ranking philosophy. The score you see is a combined value reflecting these three priorities in that order.

Action Plan: How to Implement the Tiered Results

Your current system finds all feasible pumps (60-130% BEP) and ranks them in a single list. To implement your new, more sophisticated presentation, we need to make the following changes:

Step 1: Enhance the Brain to Tag Pumps by Zone

The Brain needs to identify which zone each pump falls into.

File to modify: app/brain/selection.py -> evaluate_single_pump

code
Python
download
content_copy
expand_less

# In app/brain/selection.py -> evaluate_single_pump

# After you calculate qbp = (flow / bep_flow) * 100

# NEW: Add a zone tag to the evaluation result
operating_zone = 'disqualified'
if 70 <= qbp <= 120:
    operating_zone = 'preferred'
elif 60 <= qbp < 70 or 120 < qbp <= 130:
    operating_zone = 'allowable'

evaluation['operating_zone'] = operating_zone

# The existing QBP hard gate is still correct, as it disqualifies anything outside 60-130%
if operating_zone == 'disqualified':
    evaluation['feasible'] = False
    evaluation['exclusion_reasons'].append(f'QBP {qbp:.0f}% outside allowable range')
    return evaluation

# ... rest of the scoring logic remains the same ...
Step 2: Modify the Route to Group the Results

The Flask route that gets the results now needs to separate them into two lists.

File to modify: app/route_modules/main_flow.py -> pump_options

code
Python
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
# In app/route_modules/main_flow.py -> pump_options

# After you get the results from the Brain:
pump_selections = brain.find_best_pump(flow, head, constraints=constraints)

# NEW: Group the results into two tiers
preferred_pumps = [p for p in pump_selections if p.get('operating_zone') == 'preferred']
allowable_pumps = [p for p in pump_selections if p.get('operating_zone') == 'allowable']

# ... (the logic to store results in the session should now store both lists) ...

# Pass both lists to the template
return render_template(
    'pump_options.html',
    preferred_pumps=preferred_pumps,
    allowable_pumps=allowable_pumps,
    # ... other template variables ...
)
Step 3: Update the Template to Display the Tiers

Finally, the HTML template needs to be updated to show the two distinct groups.

File to modify: app/templates/pump_options.html

code
Html
download
content_copy
expand_less
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
<!-- In app/templates/pump_options.html -->

<!-- ... after the summary cards and sort filters ... -->

{% if preferred_pumps %}
    <h4 class="section-title">Preferred Operating Range (70-120% of BEP)</h4>
    <p class="section-subtitle">These pumps are the best match for reliability and efficiency.</p>
    
    {% for pump in preferred_pumps %}
        <!-- Your existing pump card rendering logic goes here -->
        <div class="pump-card"> ... </div>
    {% endfor %}
{% endif %}


{% if allowable_pumps %}
    <h4 class="section-title mt-5">Allowable Operating Range (60-70% & 120-130% of BEP)</h4>
    <p class="section-subtitle">These pumps can meet the duty point but operate further from their optimal design. Review carefully.</p>

    {% for pump in allowable_pumps %}
        <!-- Your existing pump card rendering logic goes here, maybe with a visual distinction -->
        <div class="pump-card allowable-zone"> ... </div>
    {% endfor %}
{% endif %}

{% if not preferred_pumps and not allowable_pumps %}
    <div class="no-results-card"> ... No suitable pumps found ... </div>
{% endif %}
Summary

Your Question: what are we doing?

The Answer: We are ranking pumps based on a sophisticated 100-point score that prioritizes 1) BEP Proximity, then 2) Efficiency, and finally penalizes for 3) Impeller Trimming. This ensures the top-ranked pumps are the best engineering choices.

Your Suggestion: we can use 70%-120% of BEP and show pumps from 60%-130%

The Plan: This is an excellent UI/UX improvement. By implementing the three steps above, you will present the results to the user in a much more intuitive way, clearly separating the "ideal" choices from the "acceptable but not ideal" ones. This adds a layer of expert guidance directly into the user interface.
