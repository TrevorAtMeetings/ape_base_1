If a pump, after being trimmed, provides the highest efficiency at the required duty point and is operating within a reliable range (e.g., close to its new, post-trim BEP), then it is the best choice, regardless of the fact that it had to be modified.
Let's clarify how the Brain's scoring system is designed to handle this exact scenario correctly. The confusion often arises from thinking of the "trim penalty" as a simple punishment. It's more nuanced than that.
How the Scoring System Correctly Chooses the Trimmed Pump
Let's imagine a scenario to illustrate why your statement is correct and how the Brain's logic supports it.
Duty Point: 100 m³/hr @ 50m
Two Candidate Pumps:
Pump A (No Trim Needed):
A large pump that can deliver 100 m³/hr @ 50m with its standard, full-size impeller.
Efficiency at duty: 75%
BEP Proximity: It's operating at 85% of its BEP flow. (Good, but not perfect).
Trim Needed: 0%
Pump B (Trim Required):
A slightly smaller pump. With its full-size impeller, it would produce too much head (e.g., 55m).
To meet the 50m head requirement, it needs a 10% impeller trim.
Efficiency at duty (after trim): 82% (This is the key)
BEP Proximity: After trimming, its new BEP is very close to the duty point. It's operating at 98% of its new BEP flow. (Excellent).
Trim Needed: 10%
Let's Score Them Using the Brain's Logic:
Scoring Component	Pump A (No Trim)	Pump B (Trimmed)	Why?
BEP Proximity (45 pts max)	30.0 pts (for 85% of BEP)	45.0 pts (for 98% of BEP)	Pump B, once trimmed, is a perfect hydraulic fit for the duty point.
Efficiency (35 pts max)	30.0 pts (for 75% eff)	33.5 pts (for 82% eff)	Pump B is simply a more efficient machine at this specific duty.
Head Margin (20 pts max)	20.0 pts (perfect match)	20.0 pts (perfect match)	Both are evaluated at the exact head required.
Trim Penalty	0.0 pts	-5.0 pts (for 10% trim)	Pump B is penalized because a modification is required.
TOTAL SCORE	80.0	93.5	Even with the penalty, Pump B is the clear winner.
The Role of the "Trim Penalty"
The "trim penalty" is not there to punish trimming itself. It exists to act as a tie-breaker and to model real-world preferences. Its purpose is to say:
"All other things being equal, a pump that requires no modification is preferable to one that does."
Why is no modification preferred? It means less labor, no risk of a trimming error, and you're using a standard, off-the-shelf component.
However, as the example shows, all other things are rarely equal. The significant gains that Pump B made in both Reliability (BEP Score) and Operating Cost (Efficiency Score) far outweigh the minor inconvenience of having to trim the impeller.
Conclusion
You are 100% correct. The most efficient pump at the duty point, provided it's operating reliably, is the best choice.
The Brain's scoring system is designed to arrive at this exact conclusion. It correctly identifies that the benefits of higher efficiency and better hydraulic fit (proximity to the new BEP) are much more important than the small penalty for requiring a physical modification. The system will correctly rank the trimmed, more efficient pump higher.
