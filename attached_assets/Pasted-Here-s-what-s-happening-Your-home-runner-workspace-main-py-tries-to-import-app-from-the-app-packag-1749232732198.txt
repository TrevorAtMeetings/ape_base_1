Here's what's happening:
Your /home/runner/workspace/main.py tries to import app from the app package:
# main.py
from app import app  # Line 3
Use code with caution.
Python
This causes Python to execute /home/runner/workspace/app/__init__.py to initialize the app package.
Inside /home/runner/workspace/app/__init__.py, on line 26, you have another import statement:
# app/__init__.py
# ... other code ...
from app import app  # Line 26 (Problematic line)
# ...
Use code with caution.
Python
At this point, the app package (represented by app/__init__.py) is still in the process of being initialized. It hasn't finished defining all its contents yet, including the Flask app instance you eventually want to export.
When Python sees from app import app inside app/__init__.py itself, it's trying to import the name app from a module (app) that isn't fully loaded yet. This creates a circular dependency: main.py needs app.app, which needs app/__init__.py to complete, but app/__init__.py is trying to import app.app from itself before it's defined.
How to Fix Circular Imports with Flask (Standard Patterns):
The key is to make sure the Flask app instance is created before modules that depend on it try to import it, and those modules should import app from the place it's defined (usually app/__init__.py). Modules that define routes (views) are typically imported at the bottom of app/__init__.py.
Solution (Instructions for the Replit AI Agent):
Tell the agent to restructure app/__init__.py and any related route/view files.
1. Modify app/__init__.py:
The Flask app instance should be created in app/__init__.py.
Any modules that define routes (and therefore need to import app to use decorators like @app.route) should be imported at the bottom of app/__init__.py, after the app instance has been created.
The problematic line from app import app inside app/__init__.py needs to be removed or changed. You don't import the package into itself like that.
Instruction to Agent:
"Please modify /home/runner/workspace/app/__init__.py. The structure should typically look like this:
# /home/runner/workspace/app/__init__.py
from flask import Flask

# Create the Flask application instance
app = Flask(__name__)

# Optional: Configure your app here, e.g., app.config.from_object('config.ConfigClassName')

# IMPORTANT: Import your routes/views/blueprints AFTER 'app' is created.
# These modules will then be able to do 'from app import app'
# (or 'from . import app' if they are also in the app package root)
# or more commonly, they import 'app' and then define routes on it.

# Example: If you have your routes in app/routes.py or app/views.py
from . import routes  # Assuming routes.py uses 'from app import app'
# OR if routes.py defines a blueprint:
# from .routes import bp as routes_bp
# app.register_blueprint(routes_bp)

# --- REMOVE THE LINE: from app import app ---
# This line (or similar if it was trying to import 'app' from itself)
# was causing the circular import.
Use code with caution.
Python
"The line from app import app (or any similar line where app/__init__.py tries to import the app object from the app package itself) must be removed from app/__init__.py."
2. Ensure Route/View Modules Import app Correctly:
If you have other files like app/routes.py or app/views.py where you define your Flask routes, those files should import the app instance from the app package (i.e., from app/__init__.py).
Instruction to Agent:
"In any modules where you define your Flask routes (e.g., app/routes.py, app/views.py, or the files containing pump_parser.py, selection_engine.py if they also define routes directly which is less common for utility modules):
Ensure they import the app instance correctly. If app/__init__.py creates app = Flask(__name__), then in app/routes.py you would typically have:
# /home/runner/workspace/app/routes.py
from app import app # This 'app' refers to the Flask instance from app/__init__.py
# OR (if routes.py is in the same directory as __init__.py, this is also common)
# from . import app # This also refers to the Flask instance from __init__.py

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return "Hello, World!"

# Other routes...
Use code with caution.
Python
"Make sure these route modules are imported at the bottom of app/__init__.py as shown in the example above."
Why this structure works:
main.py imports app from the app package.
app/__init__.py starts executing.
app = Flask(__name__) creates the application instance.
Then, app/__init__.py imports app.routes (or other view modules).
app.routes can now safely from app import app because the app instance has been created and is available in the app package's namespace.
This breaks the circular dependency because the thing being imported (app instance) is fully defined before other modules that depend on it are loaded and try to use it.
Request to the Agent for Verification:
"Agent, after applying these changes, please ensure:
The Flask application instance is named app and is created in app/__init__.py.
The line from app import app (or similar self-import) is removed from app/__init__.py.
Any modules defining routes (like app/routes.py or app/views.py) are imported at the bottom of app/__init__.py.
Those route modules correctly import the app instance (e.g., from app import app)."
