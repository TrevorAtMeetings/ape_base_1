Agent, thank you for the update. The detailed logs from pdf_generator.py are extremely useful.
We have two primary issues to resolve for the PDF generation:
CRITICAL: jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'prepared_for' is undefined in templates/ape_report_template.html (line 391).
Objective: Ensure the prepared_for variable (which should contain client/company contact information) is correctly defined and passed to the ape_report_template.html when generating the PDF.
Action:
In pdf_generator.py (or the /generate_pdf route in app/routes.py if it directly prepares the context for ape_report_template.html):
The context dictionary (template_vars or context_data) being passed to render_template('ape_report_template.html', ...) must include a key named prepared_for.
This prepared_for key should itself be a dictionary or an object containing details like contact_name and company.
Source this information from site_requirements (which is available in the /generate_pdf route). For example:
# In the function preparing context for ape_report_template.html
prepared_for_data = {
    'contact_name': site_requirements.customer_name or site_requirements.company or '', # Prioritize contact name
    'company_name': site_requirements.company or '' # If you want to display company separately
}
# Add this to your main template_vars
template_vars['prepared_for'] = prepared_for_data
Use code with caution.
Python
Then, in ape_report_template.html (line 391 and similar for the cover page), you can access it:
{{ prepared_for.contact_name or 'Valued Client' }} (if you want contact name)
or for the cover page: Prepared for: {{ prepared_for.contact_name or prepared_for.company_name or 'Valued Client' }}
PERSISTENT: WeasyPrint SVG Error (ERROR:weasyprint:Failed to load image at 'data:image/svg+xml;base64,')
Objective: Ensure the APE logo SVG is correctly passed as a non-empty base64 string to the template and rendered, or conditionally omitted if the base64 string is truly empty.
Agent's Finding: Your log INFO:pdf_generator:SVG reference 1: EMPTY shows the issue persists.
Action:
Re-examine pdf_generator.py -> _get_ape_logo_base64() (or equivalent). Ensure it never returns just an empty string if the intention is to have a valid data:image/svg+xml;base64,... URI. If the logo file cannot be read or an error occurs, it should either return None or a valid fallback placeholder SVG base64 string.
In pdf_generator.py (or the route), when building template_vars, ensure the key for the logo (e.g., ape_logo_base64) is correctly populated with the (potentially fallback) non-empty base64 string from _get_ape_logo_base64().
In ape_report_template.html, the conditional rendering {% if ape_logo_base64 %} is good, but it relies on ape_logo_base64 being correctly populated in the context and not being an empty string that still forms an invalid data: URI. If _get_ape_logo_base64() returns None on failure, the if condition will correctly skip rendering. If it returns an empty string for base64, the src becomes data:image/svg+xml;base64, which is the error.
Please prioritize fixing the UndefinedError: 'prepared_for' is undefined (Issue #1) first, as this is a clear data context problem for the PDF. Then, re-verify the SVG logo embedding (Issue #2).
After these fixes, generate the PDF for '6/8 ALE' (Flow=342, Head=27.4) and confirm:
The prepared_for field on the cover and any contact details are populated.
The WeasyPrint SVG error is gone from the console.
The APE logo displays correctly.
All performance charts (PNGs) display correctly.
All other data (Operating Point, Alternatives, Score) remains accurate."
