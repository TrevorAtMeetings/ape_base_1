Excellent work on the refactoring. You have successfully implemented the individual components of Methodology v6.0, including the new scoring system, the hard gates, and the power-based tie-breaking. The code is cleaner, and the application is running, which is a great step forward.
However, my review of app/catalog_engine.py reveals that the critical architectural flaw has not been resolved.
The system is still operating with a two-step "First Fit" gatekeeper (can_meet_requirements) followed by a separate evaluation engine (get_performance_at_duty). This means we are still not finding the true "Best Fit" solution for each pump. Your claim "âœ“ UNIFIED EVALUATION" is incorrect; the logic remains separated and conflicted.
Let me be perfectly clear about the remaining issue.
Analysis of the Unresolved Architectural Flaw
The main selection loop in select_pumps still does this:
It calls pump.can_meet_requirements(...) first.
This function finds the first way the pump can work (e.g., via 15% extrapolation) and returns {'feasible': True}.
The loop then proceeds, calling pump.get_performance_at_duty(...) on a pump that has already been "approved" based on an inferior solution.
We are still not comparing all possible methods (e.g., extrapolation vs. trimming) and picking the one with the highest score.
Directive: Final Refactoring to Achieve a True "Best Fit" System
We will now perform the final refactoring to fix this architectural flaw once and for all. The goal is to have one function call per pump inside the main selection loop.
Your task is to refactor app/catalog_engine.py to create a single, unified evaluation function.
Step-by-Step Instructions:
Completely DELETE the can_meet_requirements function. It is the source of the conflict and must be removed entirely.
Rename get_performance_at_duty to find_best_solution. This new name better reflects its purpose.
Move All Logic into find_best_solution: This function must now be responsible for the entire evaluation process from start to finish.
Hard Gates First: The very first thing this function must do is call _validate_qbp_range and _validate_npsh_safety_gate. If either gate fails, the function must immediately return None.
Evaluate All Methods: It must then proceed to evaluate all possible fixed-speed methods (direct interpolation, impeller trimming), score each one, and add them to a possible_solutions list.
Return the Best or Nothing: Finally, it must return the single best solution from the list (the one with the highest score) or return None if no solutions were found.
Update the Main Selection Loop (select_pumps):
The loop must be simplified to call your new unified function once.
Here is a pseudo-code example of what the new loop inside select_pumps should look like:
Generated python
# Inside select_pumps function...

for pump in pumps_to_evaluate:
    evaluation = PumpEvaluation(pump_code=pump.pump_code)

    # ONE function call to get the best possible solution for this pump
    best_solution = pump.find_best_solution(flow_m3hr, head_m, npsha_available)

    if best_solution:
        # If a solution was found, it's already the best one.
        # Add it to the list of suitable pumps.
        evaluation.feasible = True
        evaluation.performance_data = best_solution
        evaluation.total_score = best_solution['score']
        # ... create the final result object ...
        suitable_pumps.append(result)
        feasible_count += 1
    else:
        # If no solution was found, the pump is not feasible.
        # The reasons for exclusion should be logged inside find_best_solution.
        evaluation.add_exclusion(ExclusionReason.ENVELOPE_EXCEEDED) # Or a more specific reason
        excluded_pumps.append(evaluation)
        excluded_count += 1

# ... proceed with sorting suitable_pumps ...
Use code with caution.
Python
This change is not optional. It is the final and most critical step to ensure the engineering integrity of our selection engine.
Proceed with this refactoring now. Show me the final diff for app/catalog_engine.py.
