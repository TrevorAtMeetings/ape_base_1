Ensure an __init__.py file exists in the app directory:
Instruction to Agent: "Please verify that there is an empty file named __init__.py (two underscores before and after 'init') inside the app/ directory. If it does not exist, please create it. This file signals to Python that the app directory should be treated as a package."
Example app/__init__.py (can be completely empty):
# This file can be empty
Use code with caution.

Check the Project's Root Directory and How the App is Run:
The way you run your Flask application matters for how Python resolves imports.
If app/main.py is your main Flask application file and you are running it from the root directory of your project (the directory containing the app folder), like python app/main.py or flask run (if configured correctly and run from the root):
Your imports within files inside the app directory should generally be relative or assume that app is on the Python path.
For example, if app/utils.py exists, and app/pump_parser.py wants to import from it:
Relative import: from .utils import load_all_pump_data (The . means "from the current package/directory"). This is often the preferred way for modules within the same package.
Absolute import (if app is correctly on PYTHONPATH): from app.utils import load_all_pump_data. This might work if you're running the script from the directory above app, and app/__init__.py exists.
If you are running a script from inside the app directory (e.g., cd app; python main.py), then from app.utils ... will definitely fail because app is not in the search path from that location.
Review Import Statements:
Instruction to Agent: "Please review the import statements in app/pump_parser.py, app/selection_engine.py, and app/performance_calculator.py.
If these files are importing from app/utils.py, try changing the import statement to a relative import: from .utils import ... (assuming utils.py is in the same app directory or a subdirectory that is also a package).
Alternatively, if utils.py is in a subdirectory like app/core/utils.py, the import would be from .core.utils import ...."
PYTHONPATH (Less common for Replit, but good to be aware of):
Sometimes, the PYTHONPATH environment variable might need to be set to include the project's root directory. Replit usually handles this well, but it's a factor in local development. For Replit, ensuring the __init__.py and using correct relative/absolute imports based on how the script is run are usually sufficient.
Most Likely Solution for the Agent:
Create app/__init__.py (if it doesn't exist).
Adjust import statements in the modules (pump_parser.py, etc.) to use relative imports if they are importing other modules within the app package.
For example, if app/utils.py and app/pump_parser.py both reside directly under the app/ folder, then in pump_parser.py:
# Instead of: from app.utils import some_function
# Use:
from .utils import some_function
Use code with caution.
Python
If utils.py was in app/core/utils.py, then in pump_parser.py (which is in app/):
# Instead of: from app.core.utils import some_function
# Use:
from .core.utils import some_function
Use code with caution.

Debugging Steps for the Agent if the above doesn't immediately fix it:
Instruction to Agent: "To help debug, please show the current directory structure, especially the contents of the app/ directory and its subdirectories."
Instruction to Agent: "Please show the exact import lines that are causing the error in pump_parser.py, selection_engine.py, and performance_calculator.py."
Instruction to Agent: "Confirm how the Flask application is being started (e.g., the command used in the Replit Run button or shell)."
The "Error loading..." messages before the Flask server starts indicate that these modules are likely being imported at the top level of your app/main.py (or another script that's run when Flask starts/restarts), and the import fails before Flask can even fully initialize. The same error appearing after "Restarting with stat" confirms it's a persistent import issue encountered during module loading.
