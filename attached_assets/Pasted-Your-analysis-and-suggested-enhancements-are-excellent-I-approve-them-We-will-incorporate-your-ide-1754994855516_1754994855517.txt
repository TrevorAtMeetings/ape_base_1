Your analysis and suggested enhancements are excellent. I approve them. We will incorporate your ideas for distance normalization and including efficiency into the core logic.
Please proceed with Phase 1: Build the Core Backend Logic using the following revised and more sophisticated instructions.
Step 1: Create a New, Enhanced Method in SelectionIntelligence
File to modify: app/brain/selection.py
Action: Create the new method find_pumps_by_bep_proximity.
Revised Logic for the new method:
It should accept flow, head, and an optional pump_type.
Get the list of all pump models from the repository.
Create an empty list called candidate_pumps.
Loop through every pump. For each pump with valid BEP data (bep_flow_m3hr and bep_head_m > 0):
Calculate the normalized percentage difference for flow: flow_delta = abs(flow - bep_flow) / flow.
Calculate the normalized percentage difference for head: head_delta = abs(head - bep_head) / head.
Calculate the normalized Euclidean distance (proximity score): distance = sqrt(flow_delta² + head_delta²). A smaller distance is better.
Get the pump's bep_efficiency from the specifications.
Append a dictionary to the candidate_pumps list containing: {'pump_code': ..., 'proximity_score': distance, 'bep_efficiency': ...}.
Perform a multi-level sort on the candidate_pumps list:
First, sort by proximity_score in ascending order (closest first).
Then, as a tie-breaker, sort by bep_efficiency in descending order (most efficient first).
Return the top 20 pumps from the final sorted list.
Step 2: Create the New Backend Route
File to modify: app/route_modules/main_flow.py
Action: Add the new route /bep_proximity_results.
Logic:
It will get flow and head from the URL.
It will call the new, enhanced brain.selection.find_pumps_by_bep_proximity(...) method.
It will pass the resulting list of 20 pumps to the new template.
Step 3: Create an Enhanced Results Template
File to create: app/templates/bep_proximity_results.html
Action: Create an HTML page that displays the results in a clear, sortable table.
The table should have columns for: Rank, Pump Code, Proximity Score (%), and BEP Efficiency (%).
The "Proximity Score" should be formatted as a percentage (e.g., (distance * 100)|round(1)).
Each pump row must link to its full engineering_report page.
Request for Review:
Once you have completed all three steps of this revised Phase 1 plan, please stop.
Share the following files with me for review:
The updated app/brain/selection.py (showing the new, enhanced find_pumps_by_bep_proximity method with normalized distance).
The updated app/route_modules/main_flow.py (showing the new /bep_proximity_results route).
The new app/templates/bep_proximity_results.html template.
This revised plan is significantly more robust and will produce much more accurate and useful results. Please proceed.
