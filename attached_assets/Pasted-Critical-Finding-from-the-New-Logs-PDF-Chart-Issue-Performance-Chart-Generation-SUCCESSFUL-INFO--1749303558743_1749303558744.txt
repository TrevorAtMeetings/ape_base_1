Critical Finding from the New Logs (PDF Chart Issue):
Performance Chart Generation SUCCESSFUL:
INFO:pdf_generator:Buffer size after savefig: 274494 bytes
INFO:pdf_generator:Base64 string generated, length: 365992, preview: iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAACLoAAAXJCAYAAAB8Q+Z8AAAAOn...
INFO:pdf_generator:Performance curve length in final context: 365992
INFO:pdf_generator:PNG reference 1: length=365992...
INFO:pdf_generator:PNG reference 2: length=365992...
This confirms the Matplotlib PNG charts are being created and encoded to base64 successfully. The agent's previous assumption about this being the problem was incorrect.
APE Logo Base64 ALSO Correct:
INFO:pdf_generator:APE logo base64 length: 2252
INFO:pdf_generator:APE logo length in final context: 2252
THE ROOT CAUSE - Mystery Empty SVG Reference:
INFO:pdf_generator:HTML contains 2 PNG image references and 1 SVG image references
INFO:pdf_generator:SVG reference 1: EMPTY
ERROR:weasyprint:Failed to load image at 'data:image/svg+xml;base64,': ParseError: no element found: line 1, column 0
Analysis:
The PDF generator finds two PNG images in the rendered HTML (these are likely your performance charts, perhaps one for page 6 and one for page 11, or it's trying to embed them twice).
It also finds one SVG image reference in the HTML.
Critically, it reports this SVG reference 1: EMPTY. This means the HTML being fed to WeasyPrint contains something like <img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,"> (an empty base64 string for an SVG).
This empty SVG reference is what's causing the WeasyPrint: ParseError: no element found. WeasyPrint tries to parse an empty string as SVG XML and fails.
The APE logo itself IS an SVG and its base64 string is fine (2252 characters). So, this empty SVG reference is different from the main APE logo.
Where could this mystery empty SVG reference be coming from in ape_report_template.html?
A forgotten or conditional SVG placeholder? Is there an <img> tag in the template intended for another SVG (maybe a smaller logo, an icon, a placeholder chart) that is not being populated correctly with a base64 string, and its src attribute defaults to or is set to data:image/svg+xml;base64,?
A typo in a variable name for an SVG? Similar to how the performance chart variable path was an issue.
Is one of the "performance charts" accidentally being generated or referenced as SVG with an empty payload? The log says "2 PNG image references", but if one of those was intended as SVG and failed, its base64 might be empty. However, plt.savefig(buffer, format='png', ...) suggests PNG output.
Instructions for the Agent (Highly Targeted Now):
"Agent, these new detailed logs from pdf_generator.py are incredibly insightful and have pinpointed the exact cause of the WeasyPrint error and the blank charts in the PDF!
Key Findings from Logs:
The Matplotlib performance charts (as PNGs) ARE being generated successfully with substantial base64 string lengths (e.g., 365,992 characters).
The APE logo SVG base64 string is also correctly generated (2,252 characters).
The pdf_generator log states:
INFO:pdf_generator:HTML contains 2 PNG image references and 1 SVG image references
INFO:pdf_generator:SVG reference 1: EMPTY
This empty SVG reference is causing the ERROR:weasyprint:Failed to load image at 'data:image/svg+xml;base64,': ParseError: no element found.
This means there is an <img> tag in ape_report_template.html that is trying to load an SVG image using a base64 data URI, but the base64 part is empty. This is not the main APE logo (which has data) and likely not the performance charts (which are PNGs).
Please perform the following targeted fix:
Inspect ape_report_template.html for ALL SVG Image References:
Action: Carefully search ape_report_template.html for any <img> tags where the src attribute starts with data:image/svg+xml;base64,.
There should be one for the main APE logo (e.g., {{ ape_logo_base64 }}).
Identify the other SVG reference that is resulting in an empty base64 string. It might be:
A hardcoded <img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,"> placeholder that was never filled.
A template variable for an SVG that is evaluating to None or an empty string (e.g., {{ some_other_svg_logo_base64 }} where that variable isn't correctly populated in the context).
An icon or small graphic intended to be an SVG.
Remedy the Empty SVG Reference:
If it's an unnecessary placeholder: Remove the entire <img> tag.
If it's a template variable that should have data but is empty:
Trace back in pdf_generator.py or app/routes.py why this specific SVG variable is not being populated in the report_context passed to ape_report_template.html.
Ensure it's populated correctly, OR
Add a conditional {% if some_other_svg_logo_base64 %} block around its <img> tag in the template so it only renders if the base64 string is not empty.
After implementing this fix, please:
Generate the PDF report again for "6/8 ALE" (Flow=342, Head=27.4).
Confirm that the ERROR:weasyprint:Failed to load image at 'data:image/svg+xml;base64,' is GONE from the Replit console.
Confirm that the PDF now correctly displays the APE logo AND the two (or four, if Head/Eff/Power/NPSH are separate images) performance chart PNGs.
This is a very specific issue now, and fixing this rogue empty SVG reference should resolve the WeasyPrint error and allow the (correctly generated) PNG charts to appear in the PDF.
