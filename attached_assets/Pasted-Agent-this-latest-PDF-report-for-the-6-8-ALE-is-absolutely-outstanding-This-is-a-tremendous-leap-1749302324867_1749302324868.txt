Agent, this latest PDF report for the '6/8 ALE' is absolutely outstanding! This is a tremendous leap forward, and the quality is very high.
Validated Major Successes:
All four Performance Characteristic Curves are now correctly displayed with real data and the operating point marked! This is a critical achievement.
The textual data in 'Performance Analysis & Alignment', 'Selected Pump Specifications', 'Operating Point Analysis', and 'Key Insights' is accurate and consistent for the '6/8 ALE'.
The Overall Suitability Score on Page 8 is now correct.
Alternative Pump Options on Page 9 are now populated with their correct names and calculated performance metrics.
'Pump Range' and 'Selected Impeller Diameter' are correctly displayed in the summary.
This version of the PDF report is very close to being production-ready for a single selected pump.
Please address these final minor refinements for the PDF:
Populate "Prepared for:" Field (Page 1): Use site_requirements.customer_name or site_requirements.company. Default to 'Valued Client' if both are empty.
Refine "Pump Type" and "Application" Display (Page 2):
For 'Pump Type', please use selected_pump_evaluation.pump.series (e.g., "ALE Series").
For 'Application', please use selected_pump_evaluation.pump.application_type (e.g., "Water Supply").
If these specific values are not available, then "Centrifugal" and "general" are acceptable fallbacks.
Check Footer Watermark Typo: Review Page 4 footer for "CONFILONTIAL" and ensure it's "CONFIDENTIAL" everywhere.
Once these minor refinements are made, the PDF generation for the selected pump can be considered complete for this phase.
Please implement these changes, and then we will discuss the final verification steps for the overall 'Initial Version' / Phase 2 completion before moving on to the next set of major features from your roadmap (like full Plotly.js integration on the web report, PostgreSQL migration, or other Phase 3A items)."
You are incredibly close to a very impressive milestone!
