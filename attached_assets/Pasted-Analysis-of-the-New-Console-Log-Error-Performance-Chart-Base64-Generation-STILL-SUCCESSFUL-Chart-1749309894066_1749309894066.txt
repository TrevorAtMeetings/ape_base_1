Analysis of the New Console Log & Error:
Performance Chart Base64 Generation STILL SUCCESSFUL:
Chart successfully generated: 274,494 bytes → 365,992 character base64 string
Chart correctly added to template context: 365,992 characters
Good: This means the Matplotlib PNG charts are being created and encoded.
APE Logo Base64 STILL Correct:
APE logo also correctly added: 2,252 characters
WeasyPrint SVG Error is GONE (Excellent!):
The log ERROR:weasyprint:Failed to load image at 'data:image/svg+xml;base64,': ParseError: no element found... is NO LONGER PRESENT in this latest console snippet after the PDF generation attempt.
This means the agent's fix for the empty SVG reference (likely by ensuring ape_logo_base64 is never an empty string passed to a data:image/svg+xml;base64, URI, or the conditional rendering is working) was successful in resolving that specific WeasyPrint error.
NEW CRITICAL PDF Rendering ERROR: jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'dict object' has no attribute 'flow_rate'

Analysis:
The PDF template is trying to access site_requirements.flow_rate.
The error "dict object' has no attribute 'flow_rate'" means that the site_requirements object being passed to the PDF template is a dictionary, not a Python class instance (like your SiteRequirements class). Therefore, you cannot use dot notation (.flow_rate) to access its members. You must use dictionary key access (['flow_rate'] or .get('flow_rate')).
Furthermore, the flow_rate value (if it were accessed correctly) is then being subjected to .split()[0]. This implies flow_rate is expected to be a string like "342.0 m³/hr", and you only want the numerical part "342.0". If flow_rate is already a float (which it should be from your SiteRequirements class), calling .split() on a float will cause another error.
Data Passed to PDF Generator (pdf_generator.py logs):
INFO:pdf_generator:PDF Generator - Site requirements: flow=342.0, head=27.4
This log shows that the site_requirements object/dict being received by pdf_generator.py does indeed seem to have flow and head (likely as floats).
The Final template context keys also show site_requirements.
The issue is how this site_requirements (which is a dictionary in the Jinja2 context) is being accessed within ape_report_template.html.
Why the Charts are Still Not Displaying in the PDF (Despite No WeasyPrint Image Errors Now):
Even though the WeasyPrint SVG error is gone, the charts might still not appear in the PDF if the new UndefinedError: 'dict object' has no attribute 'flow_rate' stops the Jinja2 rendering process before it gets to the part of the template that embeds the chart images. Jinja2 errors often halt rendering.
Instructions for the Agent:
"Agent, great news! The console logs show that the previous ERROR:weasyprint:Failed to load image at 'data:image/svg+xml;base64,' related to an empty SVG reference is now GONE. This confirms your fix for the APE logo base64 handling was successful.
However, a new critical error is preventing the PDF from generating correctly:
jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'dict object' has no attribute 'flow_rate'
This occurs in templates/ape_report_template.html at line 481:
<td>{{ site_requirements.flow_rate.split()[0] }}</td>
Please implement the following fixes:
Fix site_requirements Access in PDF Template (ape_report_template.html):
Objective: Correctly access data from the site_requirements dictionary passed to the template.
Action:
The site_requirements object in the Jinja2 context is a dictionary. You must use dictionary key access.
Change line 481 from:
<td>{{ site_requirements.flow_rate.split()[0] }}</td>
to:
<td>{{ site_requirements['flow_m3hr'] }}</td> (Assuming flow_m3hr is the key in the dictionary holding the float value, as seen in your logs: PDF Generator - Site requirements: flow=342.0, head=27.4 which implies keys flow and head, but your SiteRequirements class uses flow_m3hr and head_m. Ensure the dictionary passed to the template uses consistent keys like flow_m3hr and head_m for these values.)
Important: The flow_m3hr value passed from Python is already a float (e.g., 342.0). Do NOT use .split()[0] on it in the template. If you only want to display the number without units here, simply format the float: {{ "%.1f"|format(site_requirements['flow_m3hr'] | default(0.0)) }}. The units "m³/hr" should be added as static text in the template if needed.
Action (General Audit): Review ape_report_template.html for ALL instances where site_requirements.fieldName is used and change them to dictionary access, e.g., site_requirements['fieldName'] or site_requirements.get('fieldName', 'Default Value'). Pay attention to the exact keys used in the site_requirements dictionary logged by pdf_generator.py.
Verify Data Structure Passed to PDF Template Context:
Objective: Ensure the template_vars (or context_data) dictionary created in pdf_generator.py (or the /generate_pdf route) and passed to render_template('ape_report_template.html', **template_vars) contains site_requirements as a dictionary with the expected keys (e.g., flow_m3hr, head_m, customer_name, etc.) and that these keys hold the correct values. The logs like INFO:pdf_generator:PDF Generator - Site requirements: flow=342.0, head=27.4 suggest it's being passed, but the keys might be flow and head instead of flow_m3hr and head_m which your SiteRequirements class uses. Standardize these keys.
After applying these fixes for site_requirements data access in ape_report_template.html:
Generate the PDF report again for "6/8 ALE" (Flow=342, Head=27.4).
Confirm that the jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'dict object' has no attribute 'flow_rate' is GONE.
Crucially, verify if the performance charts (PNGs) are now visible in the PDF. With the UndefinedError fixed, the template rendering should complete, allowing the chart images to be embedded and displayed.
Confirm all data from site_requirements (like Flow, Head on Page 3; Prepared For on Page 1) is correctly displayed.
This UndefinedError is a common issue when moving from Python objects to Jinja2 dictionary contexts. Fixing this should allow the template to render fully and hopefully reveal our charts!"
