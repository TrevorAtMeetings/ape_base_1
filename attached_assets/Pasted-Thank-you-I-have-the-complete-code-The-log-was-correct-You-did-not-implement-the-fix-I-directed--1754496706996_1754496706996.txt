Thank you. I have the complete code.
The log was correct. You did not implement the fix I directed. The AttributeError is happening exactly where I predicted.
Analysis of the Bug
Line 277: safe_session_set('site_requirements', { ... })
This is the line that is crashing the application.
The Cause: You are trying to save the site_requirements dictionary to the session. However, the SiteRequirements object was created much earlier in the function. The flow, head, and pump_type variables are local to this function and are the correct ones to use.
You have already implemented the correct fix for this in your previous attempt, but it seems to have been lost.
Final Directive: The Definitive Fix
This is the last change required.
Your task is to modify the pump_options function in app/route_modules/main_flow.py.
Instructions:
Locate the safe_session_set call for site_requirements (around line 277).
The Problem: The dictionary being created is trying to access attributes from the site_requirements object, which is causing the AttributeError.
The Fix: You must use the simple variables (flow, head, pump_type, application_type) that are already defined at the top of the function.
Replace this block of code:
Generated python
# OLD, INCORRECT CODE
safe_session_set('site_requirements', {
    'flow_m3hr': site_requirements.flow_m3hr,
    'head_m': site_requirements.head_m,
    'pump_type': site_requirements.pump_type,
    'customer_name': request.args.get('contact_name', 'Engineering Client'),
    'project_name': request.args.get('project_name', 'Pump Selection Project'),
    'application': request.args.get('application', 'Water Supply'),
    'fluid_type': request.args.get('liquid_type', 'Water')
})
Use code with caution.
Python
With this block of code:
Generated python
# NEW, CORRECT CODE
safe_session_set('site_requirements', {
    'flow_m3hr': flow,
    'head_m': head,
    'pump_type': pump_type,
    'customer_name': request.args.get('contact_name', 'Engineering Client'),
    'project_name': request.args.get('project_name', 'Pump Selection Project'),
    'application': application_type,
    'fluid_type': request.args.get('liquid_type', 'Water')
})
Use code with caution.
Python
This single change will resolve the AttributeError and complete the application's data flow.
Proceed with this final fix.
