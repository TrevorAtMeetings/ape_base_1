### Issues Faced and Lessons Learned

#### Major Challenges Overcome
1. **Pump Type Filtering Failure**
   - **Issue**: VTP filter showing mixed pump types instead of filtered results
   - **Root Cause**: pump_type parameter defaulting to 'General' during navigation
   - **Solution**: Systematic fix across all routes and templates to preserve pump_type
   - **Lesson**: State management requires consistent parameter passing throughout entire application flow

2. **Data Integration Complexity**
   - **Issue**: Multiple data formats (SCG, TXT, JSON) with inconsistent processing
   - **Root Cause**: Three separate processing engines with different logic
   - **Solution**: Unified processor with content-based format detection
   - **Lesson**: Data uniformity is critical for maintainable systems

3. **Chart API Caching Issues**
   - **Issue**: Stale chart data served to users after pump updates
   - **Root Cause**: Aggressive browser caching without proper cache control
   - **Solution**: Implemented cache-control headers and versioning
   - **Lesson**: Client-side caching must be carefully managed for dynamic data

#### Development Process Insights
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive end-to-end testing revealed navigation issues early
- **Documentation Value**: Detailed logging was crucial for debugging complex state management
- **Incremental Fixes**: Systematic approach prevented regression while fixing core issues
- **User Workflow Focus**: Testing actual user paths revealed problems missed by unit tests

### Current Technical Debt and Risks

#### Remaining Technical Debt
1. **LSP Warnings**: Type safety issues in catalog_engine.py and app/routes.py requiring attention
2. **Import Dependencies**: Some routes have unresolved imports for SCG processing modules
3. **Error Handling**: Need consistent exception handling across all data processing pipelines
4. **Database Migration**: Still using JSON-based catalog, PostgreSQL migration pending

#### Identified Risks
1. **Scalability Concerns**
   - **Risk**: 386 pump models loading synchronously may impact performance at scale
   - **Mitigation**: Implement lazy loading and database indexing
   - **Priority**: Medium (not affecting current operations)

2. **Data Integrity**
   - **Risk**: Manual pump data updates could introduce inconsistencies
   - **Mitigation**: Automated validation pipelines and data quality checks
   - **Priority**: High (data accuracy is critical)

3. **Single Point of Failure**
   - **Risk**: Catalog engine is central to all operations
   - **Mitigation**: Implement redundancy and graceful degradation
   - **Priority**: Medium (stable but should be hardened)

4. **Client-Side Dependencies**
   - **Risk**: Plotly.js and external CDN dependencies for chart rendering
   - **Mitigation**: Local asset hosting and fallback mechanisms
   - **Priority**: Low (CDNs are generally reliable)

### Strategic Recommendations
