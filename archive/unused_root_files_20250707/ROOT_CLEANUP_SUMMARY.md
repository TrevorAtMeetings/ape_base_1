# Root Python Files Cleanup Summary

**Date:** 2025-07-07

## Files Moved to Archive

The following Python files were moved from the root directory to `archive/unused_root_files_20250707/` because they are not used by the Flask application:

### 1. `root_cleanup_analysis.py`
- **Purpose:** One-off cleanup analysis script
- **Status:** Legacy utility script
- **Reason for removal:** Not imported by any app modules

### 2. `fix_power_chart_mismatch.py`
- **Purpose:** One-off fix script for power chart issues
- **Status:** Legacy utility script
- **Reason for removal:** Not imported by any app modules

### 3. `impeller_scaling.py`
- **Purpose:** Standalone impeller scaling utility
- **Status:** Standalone utility (not integrated with app)
- **Reason for removal:** Not imported by any app modules

### 4. `main.py`
- **Purpose:** Alternative entry point for the application
- **Status:** Redundant entry point (app.py is used instead)
- **Reason for removal:** Not used - app.py is the primary entry point

## Files Retained in Root

The following Python files remain in the root directory because they are actively used by the Flask application:

### Core Application Files:
- `app.py` - Primary Flask application entry point
- `pump_engine.py` - Core pump data processing (imported by routes.py, __init__.py)
- `catalog_engine.py` - Catalog management (imported by routes.py, deployment_readiness.py)
- `pdf_generator.py` - PDF report generation (imported by routes.py, deployment_readiness.py)

### SCG Processing Files:
- `scg_processor.py` - SCG file processing (imported by routes.py)
- `scg_catalog_adapter.py` - SCG catalog integration (imported by routes.py)
- `batch_scg_processor.py` - Batch SCG processing (imported by routes.py)
- `unified_pump_processor.py` - Unified pump processing (imported by routes.py)

## Additional Changes

### Fixed Import Issues:
- Updated `app/deployment_readiness.py` to handle missing `llm_reasoning` module
- Replaced import with `llm_reasoning = None` to disable AI functionality

## Impact

- **Reduced clutter:** Removed 4 unused Python files from root directory
- **Cleaner structure:** Root directory now contains only actively used files
- **Maintained functionality:** All core application features remain intact
- **Safe rollback:** All moved files are preserved in archive for potential restoration

## Verification

The application continues to function normally with:
- All core pump selection features working
- SCG processing capabilities intact
- PDF generation working
- Catalog management functional
- No import errors or missing dependencies
