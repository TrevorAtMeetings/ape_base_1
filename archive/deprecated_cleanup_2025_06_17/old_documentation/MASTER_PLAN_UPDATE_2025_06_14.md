## Updated Development Roadmap

### Phase 6: Technical Debt Resolution (URGENT - Week 1-2)

#### 6.1 Type Safety Sprint (Priority 1)
**Timeline**: 3-5 days  
**LSP Error Categories**:
- **scg_processor.py**: 5 errors - None type assignments, missing method definitions
- **app/routes.py**: 26 errors - Unbound variables, type mismatches, import inconsistencies
- **batch_scg_processor.py**: 4 errors - Function parameter type validation
- **Test files**: 12 errors - Data type compatibility in validation routines

**Implementation Strategy**:
1. Add comprehensive type annotations to all function signatures
2. Implement proper None checking and default value handling
3. Resolve missing method definitions in SCGProcessor classes
4. Standardize return type consistency across all modules

#### 6.2 Import Architecture Standardization (Priority 2)
**Timeline**: 2-3 days  
**Current Issues**:
```python
# Mixed patterns causing maintenance complexity
from pump_engine import load_all_pump_data  # Root level
from . import app  # Package level
```

**Resolution Strategy**:
1. Establish package-based import standards
2. Eliminate circular dependency risks
3. Create centralized import management
4. Update all modules to consistent patterns

### Phase 7: Code Organization & Maintainability (Week 3-4)

#### 7.1 Route Module Decomposition
**Current**: `app/routes.py` - 3,286 lines (oversized)  
**Target**: Modular architecture with logical separation

**Proposed Structure**:
```
app/routes/
├── __init__.py          # Route registration
├── core.py              # Main pump selection routes
├── api.py               # API endpoints and chart data
├── admin.py             # Administrative functions
├── uploads.py           # File upload and processing
├── reports.py           # PDF generation and downloads
└── analytics.py         # Project management and analytics
```

#### 7.2 Testing Infrastructure Enhancement
**Current Coverage**: Estimated 60-70%  
**Target Coverage**: >90% with comprehensive edge case handling

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Unit test expansion for all critical modules
2. Integration test suite for end-to-end workflows
3. Performance regression testing framework
4. Error condition validation testing

### Phase 8: Production Hardening (Week 5-6)

#### 8.1 Monitoring & Observability
**Components**:
- Application performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting systems
- Resource utilization dashboards
- User experience analytics

#### 8.2 Security Enhancement
**Security Audit Items**:
- Input validation strengthening
- API rate limiting implementation
- Session management hardening
